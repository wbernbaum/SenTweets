#GrahamCassidy repeals and replaces Obamacare by moving money and power out of Washington closer to patients.	#GrahamCassidy
Wow! Obamacare is a disaster for SC. Must repeal and replace with Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson For good of SC & USA – we’ll press on.https://twitter.com/postandcourier/status/911221057486557184 …	
I’m excited about solutions we have found in Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson. We press on.	
Taking money/power out of Washington & returning it to states to administer HC is the best way to replace a collapsing Obamacare system.	
I feel an obligation to fix this disaster and intend to push forward for state-centric health care vs Washington-knows-best health care.	
Obamacare is collapsing in Arizona, South Carolina and across the nation - driving up premiums and reducing choices.	
I know Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson is the best chance to repeal and replace Obamacare.	
I respectfully disagree with @SenJohnMcCain position not to proceed forward on Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson.	
My friendship with @SenJohnMcCain is not based on how he votes but respect for how he’s lived his life and the person he is.

President @realdonaldTrump is right to keep all options -- including the military option -- on the table to deal with this serious threat.	
I support President @realDonaldTrump statements he will not allow North Korea to develop a missile which can hit the American homeland.	
It's clear to me the sanctions on North Korea are not working.....and what influence China has is not being successfully used.	
Trump Admin must forcefully respond to convince N. Korea their efforts to destabilize the region & world will not be allowed to mature.(3/3)

In my view, giving the leader of North Korea the ability to strike the United States with a nuclear-tipped ICBM - is simply unacceptable.(6)	
We capitulated in the past to evil people and have always lived to regret it. (5)	
Nobody is in their right mind believes North Korea is now going to stop until somebody makes Kim Jong Un stop. (4)	
No one stopped NK because the price of taking action was deemed too high. There’s now no place for him to kick the can down the road.	
Republican and Democrat Presidents for the past 25+ years have warned and complained about the North Korean nuclear program. (2)	
Just to be clear: President @RealDonaldTrump INHERITED the mess with North Korea. He did not create it. (1)	
Cannot allow N Korea's capability to mature that puts every American in crosshairs of a nuclear attack by unstable provocative leader of NK.	
....we should deny them the ability to grow their nuclear arsenal. (2/2)	
From my point of view, not only should we deny North Korea the ability to hit the American homeland with a nuclear-tipped missile......(1/2)	
The last person I want to have the capability to strike the American homeland with a nuclear-tipped missile is the leader of North Korea.

I agree with President @realDonaldTrump, Obamacare can't be repaired. It's fatally flawed. It must be replaced.

President Obama’s ‘courageous’ approach to Syria has come back to haunt the people of Syria, the Middle East, and the world at large.	
Giving Assad a pass for his outrageous behavior was not ‘political courage.’	
It’s not ‘courageous’ to allow a ruthless dictator to kill thousands and cross red lines regarding chemical weapons. #syria	#syria

The collapse and replace of Obamacare may prove to be the most effective path forward. (7/7)	
Democrats in Congress refuse to face up to the fact that Obamacare is on the verge of collapse. (4/7)	
I believe it may take Obamacare’s collapse before the parties are willing to work together in a bipartisan manner. (6)	
Today’s House vote – where every Democrat voted in opposition – shows that Democrats in Congress are committed to protecting Obamacare. (3)	
My primary duty and job is to ensure this bill – if it were to become law – would be beneficial to the people of South Carolina. (2)	
I look forward to carefully reviewing the House-passed legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare. (1)	
A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.	
I appreciate the apparent progress on health care reform in the House of Representatives. I will admit, I’m concerned with the process.	
My position remains the same – let Obamacare collapse. Then challenge D’s and R’s to work together to replace it.https://twitter.com/leonardkl/status/859793369966534657 …

I intend to, along with @SenJohnMcCain, lead the effort in the new Congress to impose stronger sanctions on Russia.	
The sanctions announced today are a small price for Russia to pay for its brazen attack on American democracy.	
The retaliatory measures announced by Obama Administration are long overdue. But ultimately, they are a small price for Russia to pay.

Regardless of the terrorist attacks they suffer or the number of rockets fired their way, in the United Nations Israel is always the bad guy	
Obama-Kerry foreign policy has gone from naïve and foolish to flat-out reckless. With friends like these, #Israel doesn’t need any enemies.	#Israel
Any nation which backs this ill-conceived #Israel resolution and receives assistance from the US -- will put that assistance in jeopardy.	#Israel
If UN moves forward with ill-conceived #Israel resolution, I'll work to form a bipartisan coalition to suspend/reduce US assistance to UN.	#Israel

I hope President-elect Trump won’t become the 3rd American president to misjudge Vladmir Putin.	
There would be no strong Putin without a weak Obama.	
Clearly Putin was not impressed by Obama threat in September to cut it out or face consequences.	
Will be speaking with @FoxNews this morning at 10:30 am about Russia hacking. Hope you tune in.	
My goal is to put on President Trumps desk crippling sanctions against Russia. They need to pay a price.https://twitter.com/CNN/status/809179084836044800 …	
The people who work in the United States intelligence community are patriots.	
If you don't go after Russia for hacking during 2016 election you're inviting other bad actors (China, N. Korea, Iran, etc.) to do the same.	
Russian hacking during the US presidential election is not a Republican or Democrat issue. It's an American issue. We must stand together.	
Assad’s "victory" in #Aleppo is a nightmare for America.	#Aleppo
Obama sat on the sidelines as Iran and Russia went All-In for Assad....effectively destroying the Syrian opposition.	
I’m afraid Obama’s Syria policy will haunt the region and our nation for decades to come.	
The slaughter in #Aleppo is heart-breaking. President Obama’s Syria policy has been a complete disaster.	#Aleppo
4. . I expect the US-Russian relationship will be front and center in his confirmation process. #Tillerson	#Tillerson
3. ....efforts to impose sanctions on the Russian government, there are many question which must be answered. #Tillerson	#Tillerson

I look forward to meeting Mr. #Tillerson and discussing his world view – especially his views of the US-Russia relationship.	#Tillerson
Joint statement with Senators McCain, Schumer, and Reed on reports Russia interfered with the 2016 Election.pic.twitter.com/K4IXbbUADm	
I'm not challenging the outcome of the election, but very concerned about Russian interference/actions at home & throughout the world.	
Russia is trying to break the backs of democracies – and democratic movements – all over the world.	
Don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out what Russia is up to -- they're trying to undermine democracies all over the world.	
These young people have much to offer the country and we stand to benefit from the many contributions they will make to America. #BridgeAct	#BridgeAct
Our legislation -- #BridgeAct -- continues to provide legal status to them for three years as Congress seeks a permanent solution.	#BridgeAct
.....and push these young men and women - who came out of the shadows and registered with the federal government - back into the darkness.	
However, I do NOT believe we should pull the rug out and push these young men and women -- who came out of the shadows.......(continued)	
In my view, the DACA Executive Order issued by President Obama was unconstitutional and President-elect Trump would be right to repeal it.	
Cyber-attacks, undermining NATO, Ukraine, butchery in Syria, etc. I intend to look at all things Russia - not just election influence. (2/2)https://twitter.com/CNN/status/807264402344906752 …

I'm sure @RealBenCarson will be an agent of change in a department that could stand some change.	
I’m confident the waiver allowing Gen. Mattis to serve as Sec of Defense will be approved by Congress. I look forward to his confirmation.	
General Mattis will provide great leadership to the Department of Defense and President-elect Trump will find his advice to be invaluable.	
General Mattis would be an outstanding choice to serve as our next Secretary of Defense.https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/804431247577649153 …

In Wisconsin today campaigning for @RonJohnsonWI for Senate. Keeping Senate in GOP control is best insurance policy against Clinton agenda.	
Democrats are pushing the so-called "Public Option" for Obamacare. It's a nice way of saying government-run single-payer health care.	
Instead of lecturing GOP Senate candidates about Trump and his flaws why doesn’t President Obama concentrate on fixing Obamacare?	
Latest news is more proof what many of us have been saying from the start – Obamacare is a disaster for our nation. http://www.wistv.com/story/33465066/obama-administration-confirms-double-digit-premium-hikes …
