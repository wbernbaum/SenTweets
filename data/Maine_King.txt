Unfortunately, President Trump has taken the bait – and the fight against ISIS just got a lot harder.	
...to bait us into converting our opposition to their isolated brand of radical terrorism into a war of America against the Muslim world.	
Worse this order focuses exclusively upon majority Muslim countries, & plays right into the hands of ISIS which has been trying for years…	
It is inconsistent with who we are as a country.	
They only isolate America frm our allies, marginalize US Muslim population who are often the source for info that helps prevent terrorism.	
The latest actions taken by this Administration, however, don't protect us, but actually compromise our nation's security.	
…which is why I voted for the extensive border security provisions in comprehensive immigration reform bill passed by the Senate in 2013.	
I believe we must pursue solutions that will actually protect our homeland...
