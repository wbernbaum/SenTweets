Just as important, this is the first bipartisan fix to the Affordable Care Act introduced since last month's healthcare debate.

This investigation will move forward in a bipartisan way. We need to follow the facts wherever they lead.	
For all the denials we’ve heard from the administration, for anyone who’s said there’s smoke but no fire, I’m curious what they’ll say now.	
There are no excuses for what we’ve seen in the last 24 hours. Lying is not a rookie mistake.	
We now know the denials of contacts with Russians that we've heard during the campaign, transition & administration are all patently false.	
This is black and white: Trump officials at the highest levels knew Russia was working to aid Donald Trump & welcomed Russia's interference.	
That’s why we have to continue this investigation. There’s a lot more work to do.	
Trump officials keep conveniently forgetting about mtgs with Russians, only to recant after being confronted with evidence to the contrary.	
More importantly, this follows a constant and troubling pattern from the Trump campaign and administration.
