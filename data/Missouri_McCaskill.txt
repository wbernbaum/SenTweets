Not sure how vote will turn out, but we have a shot.	
There is now a glimmer of hope that we stop this and hopefully start over in a bipartisan way to stabilize ins markets and bring down costs.	
We're in legislative twilight zone.Some of my R colleagues are saying they'll only vote for the bill if they're promised it won't become law	
Painfully obvious that no Rs besides the bill handler wants to speak since he is the only one taking time.They know this is a bad bill.

I understand the angst out there today for all of you throwing stuff at me. Sorry, but I believe peaceful protest is always the right way.	
Nothing is more unAmerican than protesters who are not peaceful. Disgusting.

Because there is no replace I voted no on repeal. This is called repeal and run. Chaos is coming.	
Strong leaders set an example. If Gov Greitens is serious about ethics he would immediately disclose where 1.9 mill in secret $ came from.	
It is unimaginable that Rs would talk about replace for SEVEN YEARS with no idea how to do it. Where is the plan? Chaos is coming.	
General Kelly is good choice for Secretary of Homeland Security. I believe him when he says he "will speak truth to power." Good answers.	
Gosh almighty I wish every American would take 10 minutes to look at this data. 2016 in Charts.http://nyti.ms/2j2l3Qp
