Predatory lending in the payday loan industry is an enormous problem for anyone trying to meet their financial obligations.	
Thanks to the ACA, 62 million women in the country now have coverage for birth control & other preventive services w/o out-of-pocket costs.	
It’s 2017. It shouldn’t be up for debate that women deserve to make their own health care decisions for themselves and families.	
We need to make sure all Americans—including those in rural, tribal, low income communities—have access to reliable & affordable broadband.

Thanks to the thousands of Minnesotans who joined my call with @aarpmn last night to talk about how we can improve health care for everyone.	
These are clear messages to fraudulent for-profits that they have nothing to worry about while @POTUS is in office.	
But already, the Trump Admin has unraveled two safeguards that protect students from for-profit fraud. And now this.http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/31/devos-trump-forprofit-college-education-242193 …	
That’s like putting the fox in the henhouse. Now I believe fraud should be punished, not rewarded—I don’t think that’s a controversial view.	
Outrageously, the Trump Admin and @BetsyDeVosED have just appointed a former DeVry dean to the office that investigates higher ed fraud.	
As a result, DeVry paid $100 million to settle those claims and provide financial restitution to defrauded students.	
DeVry University, a fraudulent for-profit college, swindled tens of thousands of students by misleading them about job and salary prospects.	
I joined the millions of Americans who've voiced support in protecting #NetNeutrality, & today is the last day to submit a comment to @FCC.	#NetNeutrality
We can't destroy the internet as we know it. We must uphold #NetNeutrality protections.	#NetNeutrality
Paid prioritization would enable ISPs to amplify the voices of those w/ the deepest pockets, while quieting—if not silencing—everyone else.	
Without #NetNeutrality rules, multibillion-dollar companies could control where their users get their info and could choose to bury sites.	#NetNeutrality

The Wage Theft Prevention & Wage Recovery Act gives workers tools to make sure employers aren’t shortchanging workers’ hours, overtime pay.	
While a majority of employers are playing by the rules, wage theft is a real problem. Proud to support bill to combat this crooked practice.	
Americans are spending more hours working, but too often, bc of wage theft, they don’t get pay they’ve earned. As a result, families suffer.

If GOP truly believes in their bill, they should start making their case to Americans in an open & transparent way.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/us/politics/secrecy-surrounding-senate-health-bill-raises-alarms-in-both-parties.html …	
He’s right. It’s time for @SenateGOP to stop hiding their bill bc people across our nation deserve lawmakers who are open & honest w/ them.	
GOP @SenBobCorker said “process is better if you do it in public, and that people get buy-in along the way and understand what’s going on.”	
Americans deserve to know what’s in GOP health care bill being crafted behind closed doors & what it will mean for them and their families.	
That's no way to pass legislation in a democracy, let alone one that could rip insurance from 23M Americans and alter our national economy.	
Senate GOP has decided to take the opposite approach, shrouding their health care bill in secrecy, trying to rush bill through w/o hearings.	
When we wrote #ACA yrs ago, we had 100s of hours of public hearings, adopted 160+ GOP amendments, & then had hours of debate on Senate flr.	#ACA

Medicaid cuts wouldn’t just hurt MN, they’d hurt people across the US. I'd urge all of my colleagues to read this:https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/opinion/youre-probably-going-to-need-medicaid.html?ref=opinion&_r=1&referer …	
GOP bill "would reduce spending on Medicaid by $800+ billion, the largest single ↓ in a social insurance program in our nation’s history.”	
I also heard from nursing home resident in Moorhead who said GOP plan isn’t about taking care of people but about “survival of the fittest.”

Here’s my message to AG Sessions: stop misleading Americans, stop making excuses, and start being more forthcoming. https://www.facebook.com/senatoralfranken/posts/1393035924115619 …pic.twitter.com/zVriWxmNXM	
. @KenDilanianNBC Team Franken here. To clarify, Sen. Franken was just talking about news reports, like this one:http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/08/politics/jeff-sessions-kislyak-meeting/ …	
Attorney General Jeff Sessions needs to come back before @senjudiciary to speak honestly and openly with those who he first misled. Watch:pic.twitter.com/R0KbZKOibp	
My presumption is that after tomorrow's Senate Intel Committee hearing, there will still be questions that AG Jeff Sessions needs to answer.	
Because after recusing himself from the Trump-Russia investigation, AG Sessions recommended firing the man in charge of that investigation.	
And now news outlets have reported that he may have concealed 3rd meeting with Russian ambassador, which if true, is serious transgression.	
Glad AG Sessions will testify publicly, but I'm concerned by his evasiveness, misrepresentations, and suspicious ties to Russian officials.	
Let us honor the memory of those lost at #PulseNightclub, and lives of those who survived, by continuing work to make our communities safe.	#PulseNightclub

Attorney General Jeff Sessions owes the American people a full & public explanation before @SenatorLeahy & the Senate Judiciary Commmittee.https://twitter.com/senatorleahy/status/873864443268149248 …	
And my message to @POTUS, who's promised to defend workers and those struggling to make ends meet, is stop attacking people who elected you.	
I will oppose this disastrous, backwards bill every step of the way in the Senate, bc I represent MN families & businesses—not Wall Street.	
This is a giveaway to Wall Street bigwigs who are salivating over the opportunity to once again gamble w/ Americans’ $$$ w/o repercussions.	
But now, by attempting to give bankers & hedge fund managers control over our economy, GOP and @POTUS are inviting another financial crisis.	
When we passed Dodd-Frank, we did so to clean up Wall Street and protect Americans who lost their jobs, homes, & retirement savings in 2008.	
Dodd-Frank was put in place seven years ago to help safeguard middle-class families from another massive financial meltdown.	
In a dangerous move, @HouseGOP—at the behest of President Donald Trump—voted to rip apart the landmark Wall Street reform law Dodd-Frank.	
Yesterday, while the country was focused on James Comey’s Senate testimony, Republicans tried to pull a fast one on the American people.

President Trump wants American people & Congress to let this thing go. That’s not an option when the integrity of our democracy is at stake.	
Now more than ever we should be encouraged that there’s special prosecutor to get to bottom of what happened bt Trump’s team & the Russians.	
Former Director Comey's testimony makes the case even stronger that the President has continuously tried to undermine that investigation.	
It’s clear that President Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey because of the Trump-Russia investigation. #ComeyHearing	#ComeyHearing

I’ve urged @BetsyDeVosED to reinstate student loan borrower protections bc scrapping safeguards is not the way to stand up for Americans.pic.twitter.com/G9gKXM1YY9	
As member of @HELPCmteDems, I believe we need to address student debt crisis & put families ahead of the profits of student loan companies.	
The only way to preserve #NetNeutrality is to join together and fight back against this attack on the open internet. https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-fcc-chairman-wants-to-hand-the-internet-over-to-big-corporations/2017/04/26/d77ea2b2-2aaa-11e7-b605-33413c691853_story.html?utm_term=.323afea9e525 …	#NetNeutrality

Let me be very clear: getting rid of #NetNeutrality would destroy the internet as we know it. I plan to fight @FCC @AjitPaiFCC's proposal.	#NetNeutrality
But the new head of the @FCC, @AjitPaiFCC, announced that he’s putting the rules that safeguard #NetNeutrality on the chopping block.	#NetNeutrality
#NetNeutrality makes sure that giant corporations—like Comcast and AT&T—can’t pick and choose what content consumers can access.	#NetNeutrality

My Republican colleagues in Congress should abandon their harmful effort & work on plan that would actually help Minnesotans, all Americans.	
And @MedicaidGov? Nonpartisan @USCBO report shows GOP health care plan would end Medicaid as we know it.	
GOP plan would force rural hospitals, nursing facilities to close, limit access to providers, and jeopardize health care jobs in Minnesota.	
Nonpartisan @USCBO report makes clear what we already know: The GOP health care plan would hurt people in Minnesota and across the country.	
Nonpartisan @USCBO report: Congressional Republicans' plan would rip coverage away from 24 million people.

Tomorrow, I'll be joined by fellow @SenateDems and number of @HouseDemocrats to introduce our legislation to end #ForcedArbitration clauses.	#ForcedArbitration
Instead, consumers & workers are forced into an arbitration system where corporations can write the rules. Everything can be done in secret.	
From nursing home contracts to cell phone contracts, too often big corporations use fine print to restrict Americans’ access to justice.	
Old exec order hurt MN families. New exec order remains discriminatory, short-sighted, and completely unacceptable. https://www.facebook.com/senatoralfranken/posts/1284501714969041 …

But you know who does understand? The people who’ve lived w/—& without—the ACA. And these Minnesotans can tell you: https://www.facebook.com/senatoralfranken/posts/1277499632335916 …	
. @POTUS making such an absurd statement after calling for #ACA repeal shows he doesn’t understand irresponsible path he's leading us down.	#ACA
While talking about his plan to scrap the #ACA & its life-saving protections, @POTUS said "nobody knew health care could be so complicated."	#ACA

Mr. Pruitt represents a step backward, not a step forward. I'm urging my colleagues to join me in opposing @AGScottPruitt's nomination.pic.twitter.com/p8JuRc1Eu4	
We cannot afford to entrust the @EPA to someone that @POTUS has handpicked to slash its budget and prevent it from carrying out its mission.	
We cannot afford to entrust the @EPA to @AGScottPruitt who has a history of putting polluters’ interests ↑ the public's.

Mnuchin is example of @POTUS pulling one over on voters who elected him by stocking Cabinet, Admin with people who want to put banks first.	
Trump team could easily be called the Admin formerly known as Goldman Sachs—including the man that the Senate is voting on for Treasury Sec.	
If @POTUS wants to support American workers, he should stop trying to dismantle Wall Street reform and stand up for the #OvertimeRule.	#OvertimeRule

One of the hallmarks of Minnesota is that we accept and support each other. We Minnesotans are inclusive, sharing common values.	
. @POTUS should not waste taxpayer money chasing down his own conspiracy theories. https://www.facebook.com/senatoralfranken/posts/1239059739513239 …	
If @POTUS wants to strengthen our elections, he should work to combat efforts to suppress minority voters in our nation.	
In Minnesota, we respect our right to vote. In fact, we consistently have the highest turnout in national elections.	
Now, let’s pause for a fact check. @realDonaldTrump lost popular vote to tune of 2.86 million votes. That’s a fact, not an alternative fact.	
Mary Tyler Moore will always be immortalized in Minnesota. My thoughts are with her family and loved ones today. http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-icon-mary-tyler-moore-has-died-at-80/411785236/ …pic.twitter.com/x8dKH7g21v	
If Republicans in Congress are serious about keeping ↓ health care costs for Americans, they should pass this bill. https://www.franken.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=3606 …	
Creating public option will help stabilize prices in private insurance market, ↑ competition, cut premiums, and save taxpayers money.	
As GOP is preparing to jeopardize health care access for millions of Americans, I'm introducing something they haven't: an actual plan.	
I’m in favor of pushing real solutions for families by building on #ACA, rather than pulling the rug out from millions by repealing ACA.	#ACA
If the Trump Administration comes after net neutrality, I will fight them every step of the way. Full statement: https://www.facebook.com/senatoralfranken/posts/1237539246331955 …

It's clear that Betsy DeVos is not qualified for the job of @usedgov Sec., & I will not be supporting her nomination https://www.facebook.com/senatoralfranken/posts/1231060996979780 …

These were folks who hit annual limit, or went over lifetime cap, or maybe had pre-existing condition & couldn’t buy insurance in 1st place.	
I saw bulletin boards filled with spaghetti dinner fundraisers or meat raffles to raise money for people in MN facing a medical crisis.

3) We already asked Congressman Price some tough questions about his stock trading, which you can read here: http://www.franken.senate.gov/files/letter/170115PriceLetter.pdf …	
2) Moving stock in such a way raises some serious ethical questions, which @SenWarren, @SenatorBaldwin, and I want answers to.	
1) Bc reports revealed @RepTomPrice traded stock in companies while sponsoring legislation that could potentially affect those stock prices.	
Rep. Tom Price is @realDonaldTrump's nom for @HHSGov Secretary. His hearing is tomorrow in the Senate, but I want to see it delayed. Why?

I believe we can and should be working to amend, build on, and improve the ACA—not rip it up like the Republicans are trying to do.	
Republicans are gearing up to gut ACA without a replacement plan—a move that would take away protections from millions of Americans.

GOP lawmakers are gearing up to gut the ACA. What's the replacement plan they've presented? We're still waiting.	
The president must always put the interests of Americans ahead of his own personal $ interests. That shouldn't change with @realDonaldTrump.
