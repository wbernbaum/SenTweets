Approximately 20 million people lose coverage, Medicaid is decimated through cuts, older workers pay an age tax and premiums increase.

It's outrageous to think that anyone would support legislation that decimates Medicaid – a program designed to help our most vulnerable.

Shame on @realDonaldTrump @Reince45 @DHSgov @ICEgov for turning their back on this child and his mother. They should be better than this.	
The energy, time and resources spent on targeting a 5yr old could have been spent targeting an individual who posed a threat to our nation.	
Still no definitive answer on 5yr old & mother. Last word from @ICEgov on the family: "gone." This is a profound outrage.

Still no word from @Reince45 or Admin on the family. Going on @MSNBC at 3:35 pm to make the case, I hear @realDonaldTrump likes cable.	
Just confirmed with @DHSgov: only the White House can order this reversed now. It's on @Reince45 & @realDonaldTrump to help this family.	
Why? Because that's the tone @realDonaldTrump has set- one in which pushing out a 5yr old and his mother is somehow a good idea.	
Yup, that's right @DHSgov likely knew paperwork was in hand & rushed removal just because they could.	
Worst part: According to lawyers @DHSgov knew darn well that 5yr old & mother had secured paperwork to protect them & they rushed removal.	
The latest: Admin ordered the family on the plane. There are two flights they could be on: one direct to Honduras another with a layover.	
What I won't do: stand by silently as a vulnerable child and his mother are sent to their possible death.	
Instead of sending a 5yr old and mother back to possible death, @realDonaldTrump should focus on dangerous criminals.	
We shouldn't turn our back on a vulnerable 5yr old boy and his mother who may very well die if they get on that plane.	
This 5yr old and his mother aren't 'bad hombres.' They aren't in a gang, they're running from death- vulnerable and scared.	
. @realDonaldTrump If you're on twitter- Call @DHSgov Sec. Kelly and tell him this makes no sense.	
I've just placed a call to @DHSgov Sec. telling him to stop this. I need you to tweet @DHSgov & tell them to protect this mother and child.	
The gangs will target this mother and her child the moment they land in Honduras, yet Trump admin insists on this cruel policy.	
Despite that, the Trump admin is planning to put them on a plane TODAY. A plane ride that can very likely lead to their death.	
Targeted for death, this mother fled with her 5yr old child. The child is potentially eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status.	
Here's their story: the 5yr old's mother witnessed the murder of her cousin in Honduras and was being pursued by gangs.	
This mother & child are being held at a facility in Berks county & are being sent into danger despite the child being eligible for relief.	
Twitter: it's urgent. I just found out that a young child & her mother who came to U.S. seeking refuge will be sent back to Honduras today.	
It appears the new @HouseGOP health care amendment is just an $8 billion scheme to strip protections from those with pre-existing conditions

So to recap- @realDonaldTrump's National Security Council: Chairman of the Joint Chiefs out, former head of white nationalist website, in.	
With Bannon at the table for nat sec decisions, we can expect more politically motivated discriminatory actions like we saw last week.	
Bannon has no national security expertise while General Dunford is our highest-ranking military officer with 40 years of service.	
Yesterday, @POTUS added Steve Bannon to all National Security Council meetings but not CJCS Gen. Dunford, his senior military advisor.

An inspiring final address from my friend and colleague, @SenatorReid. Truly one of the Senate's all-time greats.	
It's outrageous that anyone would propose a temp fix- miners would be notified of their eligibility & cancellation nearly simultaneously.pic.twitter.com/VvYiJGVYNB	
Miners kept their promise to their family, to their company, and to their country. The Republicans should keep their promise to them.pic.twitter.com/S8aQEiXazK	
This so-called ‘fix’ designed in secret by Congressional Republican leadership is nothing more than a profound betrayal of coal miners.pic.twitter.com/CWjrRxe9GZ

I would urge President-elect Trump to reconsider.pic.twitter.com/vM15621rc6	
Stephen Bannon is someone who has demonstrated disregard for common decency and values that all Americans should share.	
Trump has pledged to be a President for all Americans; placing this individual in a position of such significant power undermines that claim	
I am deeply troubled that President-elect Trump has appointed Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist and senior counselor.	
Saddened to hear of the passing of Gwen Ifill. She was an exceptional journalist who brought integrity and fairness to her reporting.	
The President of the United State must lead with moral authority and denounce racism and bigotry in the strongest terms.	
It’s incumbent upon all public officials, including the President-elect, to continuously condemn these acts of hate.	
The cowards who committed these acts do not represent the values of Pennsylvania or the American people.	
What occurred at Penn is not an isolated incident, I was deeply disturbed to hear about incidents at Villanova, Council Rock, and York Tech.	
As your United States Senator, as your elected representative, I commit to continue to fight to guard your safety and protect your rights.	
If the students around this table leave here today remembering only one thing, I hope it’s this: I stand with you.pic.twitter.com/u0UOl3NaGR – at Penn Women's Center	
Today I visited with students at the @UofPenn to reinforce the message that these acts of bigotry will not be tolerated.pic.twitter.com/e7VHfJroxt – at Penn Women's Center

Closely monitoring shooting of police officers in Canonsburg. We mourn the loss of one officer & pray for the recovery of injured officer.	
As I’ve said, we have come too far for a group of white nationalists or anyone else to bully minorities out of their right to vote.	
Pleased @TheJusticeDept will monitor polls in Philadelphia following intimidation threats from white nationalists:http://billypenn.com/2016/11/07/justice-department-to-monitor-polls-in-philly-on-election-day/ …	
Today our state & nation mourns the loss of Sgt. 1st Class Ryan A. Gloyer who died in Afghanistan-a true hero & my prayers are w/ his family	
We have come too far to allow a group of white nationalists to intimidate minority voters in Philadelphia or anywhere throughout the nation.	
These plans to monitor the polls are little more than thinly veiled attempts to suppress and delegitimize the votes of minority citizens.	
The integrity of the election process is foundational to the strength of our democracy - https://www.casey.senate.gov/newsroom/releases/casey-to-doj-white-nationalists-monitoring-polls-is-voter-intimidationy …	
As White Nationalists pledge to “monitor” the polls in Philly, I'm urging @TheJusticeDept to enforce election monitoring rules.

Attack on school children in Idlib, Syria is another Assad regime war crime- the Russian government is culpable in these atrocities.

Wells Fargo scandal also makes clear why we need a strong @CFPB & should fight efforts by Congressional Rs to repeal Wall Street reform.	
Wells Fargo CEO is right to step down, but the real test is whether the company will change their predatory practices.	
That's why I'm supporting new measures that would further restrict the ability of domestic abusers and stalkers from obtaining firearms.	
Women are 5x more likely to be killed by their abuser if their abusers owns a gun.
