Know who would suffer the most under the House Republicans’ disastrous health bill? Women. Older Americans. Low income Americans.	
The Senate GOP’s health care bill is being written by 13 men! That’s shocking, even for Washington.	
Here’s how you can demand support for an independent investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia.https://makecalls.democrats.org 	
I voted against Rod Rosenstein's nomination for his refusal to commit to an independent special prosecutor on Day 1.	
The Senate shouldn't consider a new FBI Director until an independent special prosecutor is appointed to probe the Trump campaign & Russia.	
Trump is throwing our democracy into chaos by trying to shut down an investigation.	
AG Sessions lied under oath about meetings with Kislyak. One way to exert control after recusal is by getting rid of FBI Director. Chilling.

I'm voting no on Rex Tillerson's nomination as Secretary of State and will urge my Senate colleagues to join me.	
I'm with you. I support you. And I'll never stop fighting for our immigrants and refugees.	
Keep marching. Keep protesting. Keep raising your voice as loudly and forcefully as you can against this hateful and discriminatory policy.	
For those at rallies and protests in New York and across the country: After today, do not quiet down. Do not stop this fight.
