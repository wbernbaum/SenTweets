Today, the CBO confirmed what we already knew. The Republican health care plan is a disgrace.pic.twitter.com/W8WF39K5kj	
The reality is that the GOP bill is not a health care plan. It’s a $275 billion tax break for the wealthiest Americans. It must be defeated.	
Last January, Trump promised that his health care plan would provide "insurance for everybody." Now we know that was just another lie.https://twitter.com/politico/status/841382353243115524 …	
Throwing 24 million Americans off health insurance, raising premiums and defunding Planned Parenthood is a disgusting and immoral proposal.	
Remember this is the wealthiest country in history. We should not have children in poverty. We should not have people without health care.	
Republicans talk a lot about freedom and choice. But you cannot truly be free if you can't afford health care or food or medicine.	
Republicans like to talk about giving people "access" to health care. But access to care doesn't mean a damn thing if you can't afford it.	
Never lose sight of the fact that our ultimate goal is not just playing defense. Our goal is a Medicare-for-all, single payer system.	
The GOP's Obamacare replacement is Robin Hood in reverse. It throws people off insurance and raises premiums but gives millionaires a break.	
The Republican "health care" plan is a disgrace. It has nothing to do with health care. It's a $275 billion tax break for the top 2%.	
In moments of crisis, what has happened time and time again, is that people have stood up and fought back. That’s happening now.pic.twitter.com/PjjCk2XcRE	
On repealing Obamacare Republicans are scrambling, they are embarrassed, and that tells us they are on the defensive. Keep fighting back.

We need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all as a right through a Medicare for All program.

Republicans want to decimate programs for working families and give billionaires tax breaks. We must make them own up to what they’re doing.	
Let’s not forget that under the Republican plan to repeal the ACA, the top 2% will receive $346 billion in tax breaks.	
Parents should not have to separate themselves from a baby because they lack the income to stay home. We must guarantee paid family leave.	
Workers in every major country on earth are guaranteed paid family and medical leave—every major country except for the United States.	
Grotesque levels of income and wealth inequality is not just an American issue. It is a global issue. We can do better. We must do better.	
Repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement means up to 30 million people would lose insurance. 30 million people.pic.twitter.com/t2kxtRyhkL

We're the only major country not to guarantee health care as a right. Why are we debating whether to take it away from 30 million people?	
Americans should not pay the highest drug prices in the world simply because Congress is bought and paid for by the pharmaceutical industry.	
Trump is right: pharma is "getting away with murder." But do Trump and Republicans have the guts to police drug companies and lower prices?	
With or without Mr. Trump we must remain focused. Our job is to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels.	
Trump has a choice. Either he can tell Americans he lied or tell Republicans to back off and not cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.	
Mr. Trump told the American people many times he wouldn’t cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Were these all just lies?

A great nation is not judged by how many millionaires and billionaires it has. It's judged by how it treats its most vulnerable citizens.	
Mr. Trump must say clearly that he'll veto legislation that cuts Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security. He can even do it through a tweet.

In the not-so-distant past higher education was pretty close to being free. In 1965, average tuition at a 4 year public university was $243.

I wonder how many members of Congress would vote to raise the minimum wage if they had to live on $7.25 an hour for a year.	
It is not utopian thinking to say that every American should have health insurance as a right. It's a reality in many countries already.	
I worry very much about the future of democracy in our country. But I also know there is a strong desire among young people to protect it.	
2017 will be pivotal. Either we'll move toward oligarchy or millions of Americans will stand together for a government which represents all.

Americans want change but will Trump have the courage to stand up to Wall Street or will he appoint another banker to run the Treasury?	
Today, we honor the sacrifice of our veterans and their families, but our commitment to veterans must extend to every day of the year.	
If Trump is serious about being a president for all Americans he must rescind his plans to ban Muslims and deport 11 million people.	
Our job is to deal with the real issues – to deal with our rigged political and economic system – not take our anger out on our neighbors.	
This is America and we aren't going to throw out 11 million people who are undocumented. We’re not going to turn against Muslims.pic.twitter.com/jhpixSNbBw	
Millions of people are willing to put in 20 bucks, 30 bucks, 50 bucks, if there’s a Democratic Party to believe in.	
The Democratic Party has to be focused on grassroots America and not wealthy people attending cocktail parties.	
We can't be a party which cozies up to Wall Street, raises money from billionaires & stands with working families. We've got to pick a side.	
If Donald Trump takes people's anger and turns it against Muslims, Hispanics, African Americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare.

Election Day should be a national holiday so that everyone has the time and opportunity to vote.	
In a democracy the drug companies and the billionaire class should not be able to buy elections.	
Enough with cowardly politicians protecting themselves by suppressing the vote. It’s time to ensure that voting remains a right for all.	
In 2016 it is embarrassing that women earn 80% of what men make. I know every man will stand with the women in the fight for pay equity,	
Democracy is not when cowardly governors go out of their way to make it difficult for people to vote.	
You can refinance your home at 3%. Why in god's name are people paying 10% interest rates on your student debt?	
To the drug companies I say: Stop ripping off the American people. And if you don't do it on your own, we will do it for you.	
Americans are sick and tired of seeing drug prices soar when the 5 major drug companies made $50 billion in profits last year.	
Nobody who works 40 hours a week should be living in poverty. We are going to raise the minim wage to a living wage.	
The billionaire class cannot have it all. This country, this government belongs to all of us.	
The average price of insulin has gone up by more than 200% in the last 8 years. That type of greed must end.pic.twitter.com/Inyy9NYa7H	
The prices of insulin and other diabetes medications have skyrocketed. How have price increases impacted you?http://www.sanders.senate.gov/insulinprices 	
I ask that the DOJ and FTC investigate whether pharmaceutical companies manufacturing insulin products have colluded in setting prices.	
In fact, Eli Lilly and other companies have been fined in Mexico for colluding on insulin pricing.	
Not only have drug corporations raised insulin prices by double digits overnight – often the prices have increased in tandem.pic.twitter.com/kQhaVdxPfA	
About half the money that has been contributed to the 2016 presidential race has come from just 158 of the wealthiest families in America.

It makes no sense that the same drug that costs $70 in France costs $450 in the US. We should reduce barriers to importation of drugs.pic.twitter.com/h3MzOSCI7g	
There are many reasons the Dakota Access Pipeline should be stopped. I want to call attention to a few of the biggest. #NoDAPL	#NoDAPL
We must stand united with our Native American brothers and sisters and say: Stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. Respect Native American rights.

Americans shouldn't pay higher prices than Canadians for the same drugs simply because Congress is bought by the pharmaceutical industry.pic.twitter.com/082SiLrkvX

Mr. President: It's time to take a stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline just as you stood against Keystone.https://medium.com/@SenSanders/stop-the-dakota-access-pipeline-204786bfeeef#.2qtrl784k …	#
The Dakota Access Pipeline would be a huge blow to our fight against climate change. #NoDAPLpic.twitter.com/47m6yUu4m5	#NoDAPLpic
We should not be building new oil pipelines that lock us into burning fossil fuels for generations to come.	
. @POTUS you took a bold stand against the Keystone pipeline. I ask you to take a similar stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline.	
It's distressing that the government is putting oil industry profits ahead of the treaty & sovereign rights of Native American communities.	
. @POTUS must take all appropriate measures to protect the safety of the peaceful protesters gathered to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline.	
It is more than irresponsible for my Republican colleagues to risk the future of our planet in order to pander to fossil fuel lobbyists.	
Climate change is happening and it is caused by humans. That is plainly not debatable at this point.	
Considering the planetary crisis we face, it is completely inappropriate to continue giving billions in tax breaks to fossil fuel companies.	
When scientists tell us that we must transition away from fossil fuels, the last thing we should do is drill for oil in the Arctic.	
These guys in the pharmaceutical industry, in my humble opinion, are crooks.pic.twitter.com/gqVI29BvyP

Today, a few giant media conglomerates control much of what Americans see, hear and read. We need more diverse media ownership, not less.	
It has never occurred to me to deny the vote to people because they might vote against me. People who do that are political cowards.	
What democracy is about is all people having the right to participate in the political process—not making it harder for people to vote.	
Republicans shouldn’t be able to disenfranchise voters whose political views are an inconvenience to them.	
Investigators found 31 cases of voter fraud out of a billion votes. That in no way justifies the voter suppression we’re seeing today.	
The administration should kill the Time Warner/AT&T merger. This deal would mean higher prices and fewer choices for the American people.https://twitter.com/AP/status/789981302439153666 …	
We have virtually no voter fraud in America. What is the fraud is that people are changing laws because of so-called voter fraud.	
1 of 5 Americans age 19-64 cannot afford their prescriptions. Meanwhile, the 5 largest drug companies made $50 billion in profits last year.	
By closing loopholes that let companies stash profits abroad, we could save taxpayers almost $700 billion. That’s our whole defense budget.	
Any politician who passes laws to suppress the vote is a political coward and needs to get another job.	
51 million people in this country have no paid sick leave. Not only is that damaging to our economy, it is morally wrong.pic.twitter.com/wflztKw7g4	
It is not utopian thinking to say that every American should have health insurance as a right. It's reality in many countries already.	
The United States of America must join every other major country on Earth in guaranteeing health care to all its people as a right.	
I happen to believe health care is a right of all people. Where did that right come from? From being a human being.	
At a time when high school graduation rates are at all time highs, the next logical step is to make public colleges tuition free.	
When people leave college they should be able to start their life with excitement, not be saddled with outrageous levels of student debt.	
Universal health care is a reality in dozens of countries around the world. It really is not a radical idea for the U.S. to do the same.	
In 1965, ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay was 20:1. In 2014, it was 303:1. That’s just incomprehensible to me.	
Apparently for many in the top 1%, owning and controlling our economy is not enough. They also want to own and control the government.	
The CEOs of drug companies should not be making millions when customers are dying because they cannot afford their medication.	
The drug industry is getting very, very nervous. We are going to take them on and lower the cost of medication across this country.https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/787010021435604997 …	
If you can make billions every single year, you can pay your employees a livable wage.	
Drug corporations' greed is unbelievable. Ariad has raised the price of a leukemia drug to almost $199,000 a year.https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2016/10/07/ariad-riases-leukemia-drug-price/ …	
I wish I could say that we as a country have made enough progress for all Americans to truly be equal by now. But, no, our fight must go on.

We won't survive if we continue to destroy nature. Until the tribes are consulted, all Dakota Access pipeline construction should be halted.

Those concerned about the cost of transitioning to renewable energy should truly fear the cost of failing to do so as soon as possible.	
Students who study hard get hit with insurmountable debt while bankers who crashed the economy get a bailout. That’s unacceptable.	
I think the evidence is overwhelming that trickle-down economics is a fraud. It works for the very wealthy, not working families.	
When the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, I’m pretty sure they weren’t thinking “Let’s make sure billionaires can buy elections.”	
I've met so many people with dreams of progress and opportunity. But that can’t happen in an economy that funnels all wealth to the top.	
Change happens when people rise up and say, “This is not the world in which we want to live.”	
We are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don't think that is the nation we should be living in.	
Young people are our future. It doesn't do us any good to discourage them from attending college with massive tuition costs.	
Here’s a crazy idea – let’s put more money into jobs and education instead of paying to incarcerate millions of our people.
