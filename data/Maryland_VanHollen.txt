I'm seriously concerned that the Republican budget will pass if we don't put the same energy into defeating it as we did with Trumpcare.	
Here’s my take: The Republican budget needs to be getting more attention. Read the fine print—it’s worse than Trumpcare.	
For example, let's pass @SenFeinstein’s bill to ban bump stocks & close the loophole that lets semi-automatic guns function as machine guns.	
And there are common sense solutions we can take to reduce the carnage of gun violence.	
Of course, we can’t prevent all acts of evil—but we were sent to Congress to pass the best laws we can to protect Americans.	
Those who try to stifle debate about how to reduce gun violence are not honoring the victims. They are guaranteeing more victims.	
Don’t be shy about speaking out against the GOP’s awful #TaxReformPlan. Just like #Trumpcare, we cannot allow this to see the light of day.	#TaxReformPlan #Trumpcare
Third @SenateDems principle: #TaxReform should go through a normal legislative process, as @SenJohnMcCain has said.	#TaxReform
Second @SenateDems principle: #TaxReform should not add to the national debt, as @SenateMajLdr had promised.	#TaxReform
First @SenateDems principle: #TaxReform should truly help the middle class—absolutely no tax cuts for top 1%.	#TaxReform

Republican leaders must speak up & defend our nation's values. Patriotism knows no party -- we all must denounce this threat to freedom.	
It's a sad day for our country when our Commander-in-Chief is acting more like Vladimir Putin than an American president.

I join 168 of my Democratic colleagues in calling on Trump to rescind his job offer to alt-right leader Steve Bannon—http://bit.ly/2fXXfz6

If Trump wants to be "president for all Americans," he can start by rescinding his job offer to Bannon. He has no place in the White House.pic.twitter.com/SeXULjobb9	
My sleeves are rolled up and I'm ready for the challenges ahead. Together, let's get to work.	
We must call out hate wherever we see it. We cannot forget that America's story is rooted in the fight for equality for all people.	
I commit to working every day for the America I love: a decent nation, a beacon of hope, a defender of liberty and justice.	
As I prepare for the honor and duty of serving all of Maryland, my resolve to fight for the character of our nation has never been stronger.	
Divided we fall, divided we fail. We must stand firmly together to overcome our many pressing challenges.	
Divided, we cannot protect our society's most vulnerable. Divided, we hand those stoking fear for political gain the ugly power they seek.	
We cannot allow ourselves to be torn apart by hate. Divided, we cannot defend the progress we've made as a nation.	
From racist and anti-Semitic graffiti in Md. to attacks on Muslim women in Cali., the effect of Trump's campaign rhetoric is in full view.	
The America I believe in is a land of decency, respect, and liberty. These ideals have been challenged in recent days.	
To the brave men and women of our military who put their lives on the line in defense of our freedom & liberty: thank you. #VeteransDaypic.twitter.com/osWQlg4crS	#VeteransDaypic
