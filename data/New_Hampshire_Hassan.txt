Bottom-line: The #GrahamCassidy bill is just as dangerous as prior attempts to repeal the ACA & we must stop it in its tracks	#GrahamCassidy
10)This bill has been introduced in the midst of bipartisan efforts to strengthen the individual insurance market, putting that work at risk	
9) Like prior versions of #Trumpcare, this #GrahamCassidy bill targets women's health and bars state reimbursements to Planned Parenthood	#Trumpcare #GrahamCassidy
8) It guts the requirement that insurers must cover essential health benefits like substance use disorder, mental health & maternity care	
7) It would allow insurers to hike people’s premiums the moment they get sick, even if they've been paying while healthy for years	
6) This bill would lead to higher out-of-pocket costs & take away premium assistance from millions of hard-working people	
5) #GrahamCassidy also undermines protections for people with pre-existing conditions	#GrahamCassidy
4) It cuts over $410 million dollars in federal funding for Medicaid to NH by 2026	
3) These massive Medicaid cuts would also lead to funding cuts for school districts and students with disabilities	
2) It caps and cuts Medicaid for seniors and people who experience disabilities – putting community-based care programs at risk	
1) It ends Medicaid expansion, which experts have called the #1 tool at our disposal to combat the opioid crisis	#1
