6/ Lowers the tax rate for the top earners only to raise the tax rate for lowest earners.	
5/ Blows up the debt. Allows these tax cuts to increase deficit $1.5 trillion.	
4/ $1 trillion cut to Medicaid & $470+ billion cut to Medicare – programs that provide critical coverage to families, kids & seniors in VA.	
1/ Tax cuts are for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. 80% of the benefits could go to the top 1%.

I'll be on #MTP this morning discussing Syria & why President Trump must get authorization from Congress to use military actionhttps://twitter.com/meetthepress/status/851027159401496576 …	#MTP
Time for the President to follow the Constitution! Time for Congress to do its job!	
Quoting citizen Donald Trump in 2013: "The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria--big mistake if he does not."	
2001 AUMF doesn't give legal authority for the airstrikes in Syria. It was drafted for military actions vs 9/11 terrorists	
Trump Administration has escalated ground combat in Syria and now air strikes against a Syrian airbase. All without Congress	
Assad is a brutal dictator who must be held account for atrocities. But the President's failure to seek congressional approval is unlawful	
President waging military action against Syria without a vote of Congress? Unconstitutional.

President Trump: "Nobody knew health care could be so complicated."	
New CBO score confirms what we’ve always known on #TrumpCare. It covers less, raises costs & is still one big tax break for the wealthiest	#TrumpCare
GOP should take this opportunity to abandon #TrumpCare that would harm millions, sit down with Dems & talk seriously about improving the ACA	#TrumpCare
#TrumpCare won't improve the quality of care for Americans or lower costs. ACA already works for millions. Let's improve it, not break it!	#TrumpCare
Using #ACA anniversary as an arbitrary deadline to rush through #TrumpCare for symbolic reasons is ridiculous. GOP must take this seriously	#ACA #TrumpCare
#TrumpCare ends the #ACA #Medicaid expansion & dismantles the program as we know it. Bad for millions of Americans who depend on #Medicaid	#TrumpCare #ACA #Medicaid #Medicaid

Hillary just showed us why she'll make such a great president. I couldn't be prouder to be her running mate.	
"I won't let in dangerous people, but I won't slam the door on women and children.” Hillary couldn’t be more right on refugees.	
Good advice, @HillaryClinton. Factcheck: Donald Trump wrong on claim that he opposed Iraq War.pic.twitter.com/ilwRVlOoLs	
Donald won't commit to support our election outcome, won’t condemn Putin, and won't defend American democracy. Yet he wants to be president.	
The Clinton Foundation has an A+ rating from Charity Watch. Donald’s was prohibited from doing business in New York. What a fraud.	
Time and again Trump shows us he can't see women as equal. Watching Donald defend his behavior makes me sick to my stomach. #DebateNight	#DebateNight
Will Trump condemn the Russian effort to influence the outcome of our election? No—he takes Putin's side. We need a president, not a puppet.	
Donald wants to send Roe v. Wade “back to the states.” That means states could criminalize women—trust them with their own health decisions!	
If you wouldn't hire Donald Trump to work at your company, why should we hire him to run our country? http://hrc.io/2ei8x0u

Donald thinks energy is “under siege by Obama?” We’ve got lower prices, energy independence, AND a clean energy revolution.

Donald says he'll be devoted to ALL Americans, so why does he trash immigrants, African Americans, Muslims, women, people with disabilities?	
Trump keeps whining to the moderators about how much time he's getting on his answers. Thin skin!	
Donald says Russia and Syria are killing ISIS? They're killing Syrian citizens. And he acts like they are fighting terrorists? Get real.	
Trump basically admits that he's not paying federal taxes. Blue Star families like ours don't appreciate him stiffing our troops.	
Donald—you can’t show us your plans because you have none. #Debate	#Debate
This isn’t just about Donald’s comments on women—he’s spent this entire campaign putting down Americans from all walks of life.	
Trust me; what we’re hearing from Donald isn’t just “locker room” talk—it’s demeaning, and it’s wrong. #Debate	#Debate
