I won't vote for Obamacare Lite that keeps 90% of the taxes & spending just so some people can claim credit for something that didn't happen	
No one is more opposed to Obamacare than I am, and I've voted multiple times for repeal. The current bill isn't repeal.

The Senate fell one vote short tonight, which is disappointing. I intend to keep fighting for repeal.	
This week, I voted multiple times to repeal Obamacare, including offering my own clean repeal bill.	
5. Expand HSA (larger maximum contributions) 6. Push and fund expansion of 1332 waivers for states to opt out of many regulations	
3. Repeal 3 years of medical device tax 4. Defund Planned Parenthood for 1 year	
The next healthcare vote will be soon. The bill will: 1. Repeal Individual Mandate tax/penalty 2. Repeal the job killing Employer mandate	
Just voted YES on the Heller Amdt. to permanently repeal the burdensome "Cadillac" tax on health insurance plans	
830 vote is to repeal the Cadillac tax, an Obamacare tax that increases costs of insurance & costs job creators and workers billions.

Repealing mandates & taxes, without new spending and bailouts. This is the path I've been urging, and what I discussed with @realDonaldTrump	
This morning, @SenateMajLdr informed me that the plan for today is to take up the 2015 clean repeal bill as I've urged.	
I hope my colleagues will join me in this dual path – clean repeal and oppose the bailoutshttp://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/343435-will-the-swamp-defeat-obamacare-repeal?rnd=1500911743 …	
Asset forfeiture is an unconstitutional taking of property without trial. It's wrong and I call on the AG and the Adminsitraion to stop.	
What I'm most concerned about though is the Attorney General's actions yesterday to push forward with federal asset forfeiture.	
I agree with @realDonaldTrump, his Attorney General should not have recused himself over reported incidental contacts with Russian officials

A year ago the Senate voted to let 9/11 victims sue Saudi Arabia. Now we are going to sell them weapons? What are we thinking?	
There is an abundance of evidence that high level Saudis were complicit in 9/11. The 28 pages show that. Why would we give them arms?	
Even @HillaryClinton when she is speaking honestly in emails, noted the Saudis have supported terrorism. Why would we give them anything?	
We must stand up and tell Saudi Arabia ENOUGH. They are the biggest exporter of extremism and hatred in the world.	
Saudi Arabia is causing a humanitarian crisis with a war in Yemen. It funds extremism worldwide. Abuses human rights. Stop arming them now.	
The vote will be close. It is time we stop the counterproductive and harmful practice of arming a country that promotes extremism

It keeps individual mandate but makes you pay the insurance companies instead of the government	
Their plan keeps the Obamacare "Cadillac Tax" forever, which is a tax on the best health insurance.	
The House leadership Obamacare Lite plan has many problems. We should be stopping mandates, taxes and entitlements not keeping them.	
Th House leadership plan is Obamacare Lite. It will not pass. Conservarives are not going to take it. #FullRepeal	#FullRepeal
Still have not seen an official version of the House Obamacare replacement bill, but from media reports this sure looks like Obamacare Lite!	
Another day without the bill in the hands of the American people and their representatives. But @politico has it!	
Today my staff and @randpaulcopier continued the search for the secret House Leadership Obamacare Lite billpic.twitter.com/G32duw04Pl	
Oh look. @politico has more details on the House Obamacare Lite plan. Hey @pauldemko can I get a copy?	
We are continuing our search for the Obamacare Lite bill! Do you know where the secret location might be? Has anyone seen the bill?pic.twitter.com/WcSIDTs0vP	
The Obamacare replacement bill remains hidden from the public! What secret location will they meet in this weekend to work on it?	
I am heading to the secure location where they are keeping the House obamacare bill. I will demand a copy for the American people.	
And I call on them to make this process transparent and to let the sunshine in. Today.	
I will not vote for Obamacare Lite nor will many of my colleagues. We will keep our word. I call on House leaders to do the same	
I demand the House release the text of the bill. Every elected official & every American deserve to know what they're trying to do	
House and Senate passed repeal in 2015. They should keep their promises and bring them up again for a vote now	
Renaming and keeping parts of Obamacare, new entitlements and extending medicaid expansion are not the #FullRepeal we promised	#FullRepeal
What is the House leadership trying to hide? My guess is, they are trying to hide their "Obamacare Lite" approach.	
This is unacceptable. This is the biggest issue before Congress and the American people right now.	
I have been told that the House Obamacare bill is under lock & key, in a secure location, & not available for me or the public to view.
