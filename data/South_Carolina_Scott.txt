Our nation’s strength lies in our diversity. We are powerful & accepting, & should stand ready to defend liberty & justice for all.	
There is absolutely NO gray area when it comes to condemning groups who breed on racism, hate and division.	
Our American family deserves conspicuous,determined leadership that stands in the gap for principles of freedom and the pursuit of liberty	
Evil lurks in dark places. It is our responsibility to stop violence in its tracks and prosecute it to the fullest extent of the law	
From my house to the White House, let's be clear.	
Let us not repeat history with ambiguity when it matters the most.	
Too many good people chose silence and not activism against the forces of darkness and evil.	
The 1960s was a painful time when people of good conscience refused to stand up and be counted.	
My party&our nation must stand united against hate, racism& groups/individuals who want to reject the truth that we are all from one blood.	
The moral authority of this nation rests upon clarity of convictions & actions that reinforce our commitment to the greater good for all!	
We must stay unified. We must hold true to what makes us who we are as a nation. My op-ed in @USATODAY -https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/08/14/fight-hatred-fear-domestic-terror-with-american-ideals-tim-scott-column/564755001/ …	
We are Americans from all walks of life, working towards the American Dream. Nowhere in that dream is there room for http://racism-usat.ly/2wYXzTc

20. I’m also not going to stop looking for a solution – giving up isn’t what we were sent here to do.	
19. I’m not going to give up on repealing the Unaffordable Care Act. American families deserve better.	
18. I truly believe we all want what’s best for our nation and her people. To me, that’s finding a better solution than the ACA provides.	
14. The ACA is not sustainable, and hasn’t been from the beginning. Its foundation was built on certain groups that never signed up	
13. I remain committed to repealing the ACA and replacing it with a system that works for all families	
11. We’ve got to realize that our pattern should not be disagree and destroy, but rather disagree and solve	
10. And two – along the way we stopped fighting the policy, and started fighting the people behind it	
9. No matter how badly the program serves (or doesn’t serve) the people – replacing an entitlement is hard	
8. The ACA went into effect, and – “A government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we’ll ever see on this earth” (Reagan)	
6. These are facts – you can’t argue with them. And that’s not how our health care system should work	
5. Not everyone got to keep their doctors, and they weren’t able to keep their plans	
4. Millions are paying for insurance they don’t want. In SC, more than 100,000 stuck without an option	
3. In South Carolina, we’re down to one insurer offering plans on the exchanges.We’re seeing triple digit premium hikes,sky high deductibles	
2. The debt continues to grow, and the ACA is not getting any better. The former isn’t helped by the latter.	
1.When I was elected to Congress in 2010–along w/a record-breaking Freshman class,the major platform was repealing the ACA&the national debt

7. I believe every American wants one thing - the opportunity to succeed. To make sure their family has a bright future.	
6. There is amazing work being done in communities across our nation every day, but their efforts aren’t always recognized by policymakers.	
3. We have created a poverty floor, but not the opportunities needed for every family in every community to find success.	
2. The solutions of the past 50 years, while well intentioned, simply have not gotten that job done.	
1. We need 21st century solutions to battle poverty and ensure opportunity for all.

As you start to come home, remember to stay safe! Don't go around barricades, drive through flood waters. Fill up gas in case of traffic.	
Remember: avoid floodwaters, don't touch downed power lines, be very careful w/generator ventilation. Storm leaves, but dangers remain.
