Women, minorities, the LGBTQ community & workers have gained much under SCOTUS – and have much to lose under Gorsuch. #StopGorsuch	#StopGorsuch
If Gorsuch can’t gain 60 votes, GOP should withdraw his nomination and put forth a nominee who both sides can agree on.	
If Gorsuch can't get 60 votes, I urge my GOP colleagues to withdraw his nomination and put forward someone who can gain bipartisan support.	
I hope my GOP colleagues recognize the serious ramifications their unprecedented actions will have on our Court, the Senate, & our country.	
This change threatens to politicize our courts, fundamentally change the way the US Senate operates, and will polarize our country more.	
Judges confirmed to the Court must be confirmed with a bipartisan vote to avoid confirming ideological judges with a political agenda.

Proud that my 1st bill as a US Senator focuses on protecting the rights and safety of immigrant communities that make this country so great.	
We need to honor our history as a nation of immigrants and work to reform our immigration system – NOT call for mass deportations.	
In my home state of Nevada alone, comprehensive immigration reform would bring more than $34B in economic activity over the next 3 decades.	
Immigration isn't only about keeping families together. Experts across ideological spectrum agree: immigration reform will grow our economy.	
Today I will introduce my first bill as a U.S. Senator that will rescind Trump’s massive deportation executive order.	
If confirmed, Mulvaney would gladly repeal the ACA and defund Planned Parenthood. I will vote NO on his nomination as next OMB director.	
Rep. Mulvaney’s calls to slash Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security are a reckless affront to the millions who rely on these programs.	
Puzder was deeply unqualified for this role and was right to withdraw. Nevada’s working families deserve a Labor Sec who will fight for them

The BLM’s methane rule makes our air cleaner and our communities safer. It should not be overturned and I oppose GOP efforts to do so.	
Imperative that we fully investigate Russia’s involvement in Trump administration. Flynn's resignation could be just the tip of the iceberg.	
Trump nominated former OneWest Bank CEO, Steve Mnuchin, who before that was a Goldman Sachs executive. So much for “draining the swamp.”	
Foreclosure King Steve Mnuchin is not someone who will be looking out for working people when he implements our nation’s economic policy.	
OneWest Bank, under Mnuchin’s leadership, turned $3 billion in profit while evicting 3,654 Nevada families from their homes.	
A judge in Wisconsin cited Mr. Mnuchin bank’s “harsh, repugnant, shocking, and repulsive” practices when deciding a suit against them.	
While Nevadans struggled through the Great Recession and housing crisis, Steve Mnuchin’s Nevada foreclosure machine claimed 3,654 homes.	
Nevadan Heather McCreary is one of Mnuchin's victims. His nomination is slap in the face for families like Heather’shttp://www.rgj.com/story/opinion/voices/2017/01/24/one-view-treasury-nominee-profited-sparks-familys-suffering/96971260/ …

Rep. Price wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, even if that means 370,000 Nevadans losing access to safe and affordable health care.	
Rep. Tom Price’s healthcare agenda would hurt millions of Americans. I will not vote for him as the next Health & Human Services Secretary.

To the thousands of Nevadans who voiced opposition to DeVos, I heard you loud and clear. Continue to speak out. Our fight doesn't end here.	
DeVos’ approach on education has been disastrous to her own state of Michigan. How can we trust her with our students' education and future?	
We need an Education Secretary who will fight for the success of our public schools, not one whose life’s mission has been to undermine them	
DeVos spent decades fighting to divert money away from public education, undermining the promise of a high quality education for every child	
DeVos is wildly out of her depth on major policy areas that would be under her jurisdiction if confirmed. Our students deserve better.	
Betsy DeVos’ ideology is diametrically opposed to the Department of Education’s mission of ensuring equal access to a great education.	
Diversity is our strength. Looking forward to a productive & historic 79th #nvleg session with @AaronDFordNV & @JasonFrierson at the helm.https://twitter.com/MichelleRindels/status/828698632224284673 …	#nvleg
