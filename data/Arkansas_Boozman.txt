I will continue to work to promote policies that help U.S remain competitive & create jobs while pushing for human rights & change in Cuba.	
It would be more effective to continue an open line of communication & working relationship w/a government in need of democratic assistance	
By rolling back reforms that have benefited U.S. citizens, everyday Cubans and our economy, we are taking a step backward, not forward.	
But a return to embargo-like policies is the wrong approach. We ran this play over and over again for 50 years & results have not changed.
