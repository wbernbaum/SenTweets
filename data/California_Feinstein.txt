To my colleagues who are undecided, make no mistake, the final vote on health care will be among the most important you will ever take.	
Senate Republicans are moving forward on repealing the Affordable Care Act with no idea what's next. It's the height of irresponsibility.	
This is a gut-check moment. Senators need to decide whether taking health coverage away from millions is what they were sent here to do.	
I’m appalled you keep going after Hillary. She can’t be the reason for your every vendetta. You’re the president—start acting like it!https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/889790429398528000 …	
We may have lost this battle, but the war continues! We must defeat the dangerous Republican effort to devastate health care!	
Medicaid covers 74 million Americans. It’s unconscionable to cut it by 35% without ONE hearing to consider the effects. #SaveMedicaid	#SaveMedicaid
We're voting to advance a health care bill in ONE HOUR, but no one has any idea which bill. This is an assault on our democracy. #SaveACA	#SaveACA
I would have thought providing health care for children was nonnegotiable. Republicans don’t seem to think so. Shameful. #Trumpcare	#Trumpcare
We need answers. That’s why the Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena for Paul Manafort. http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=press-releases&id=50716EA5-3CA6-47BC-B655-CE8E7BD544BE …pic.twitter.com/wCKK3Attfq	
Care for children with the most serious health care needs will be put at risk if we slash Medicaid. The Republican bill must be defeated.	
I don’t understand how anyone could vote to advance a bill that takes health care away from millions without hearing from those affected.	
Each version of the Republican health care bill goes beyond repealing Affordable Care Act—ending Medicaid as we know it.	
FACT: Republican health bill would increase premiums for older Americans. Junk plans that don’t cover needed care are NOT “freedom.”	
Make no mistake, a 'yes' vote on health care is an endorsement of the most indefensible process on a major bill I’ve seen in 24 years.	
Gutting Medicaid threatens children’s hospitals nationwide—endangering the lives of our most vulnerable children. Terrible!	
Our job is to protect children. I’ll do all I can to defeat a bill that jeopardizes health care for 36 million children covered by Medicaid.	
Tomorrow Republicans will try to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We must make sure they don’t succeed. Keep making calls!	
Contrary to Republican talking points, ACA is NOT failing. Over 1.5 million Californians currently rely on @CoveredCA for access to coverage

We saw what happened in the House of Representatives. They passed a bill after everyone thought it was dead. We can’t let that happen again.

The moment we let our guard down is the moment Republicans try to jam their disastrous health care bill through the Senate. Keep calling!

It’s past time Republicans come to the table to work with Democrats on health care. We’ve been ready to work to improve Affordable Care Act!	
Our job is to solve problems. We must come together in an open hearing process to improve the Affordable Care Act—not ignore challenges.	
The fight on health care isn’t over. We must keep up the pressure. Keep calling and sharing your stories.	
Here’s how we can improve health care: both parties come together, hold hearings, listen to experts, consider public input. End the secrecy!	
Republicans should now realize that any effort to pass a health reform bill should be bipartisan and transparent.https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=2FA9A6BE-83F1-4B57-B899-E40845728A8E …
