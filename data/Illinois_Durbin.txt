Last time Illinois had a high risk pool, less than 1% with pre-existing conditions were included & they still faced waiting lists

In IL, repealing health care would result in a multi-billion $ loss in economic activity & over 84,000 Illinoisans would lose their jobs	
Repeal of health care would #MakeAmericaSickAgain, leaving over 29M people across the country–and 1.2M in Illinois–without health insurance	#MakeAmericaSickAgain

The NPVIC is an agreement between states to award all their electoral votes to whichever presidential candidate wins the popular vote	
Americans who want to see Electoral College reform can start by encouraging their state to pass the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact	
We face an uphill battle in Congress to reform the Electoral College, so it's up to states to show leadership & act http://bit.ly/2hQC2FY 	
A relic from a shameful period in our nation’s history, the Electoral College allows some votes to carry greater weight than others

I’m joining @MSNBC NOW to discuss Russian interference in our election and call for an Intelligence estimate before Jan 20	
If the investigation finds evidence that Russian officials perpetrated or directed such acts, appropriate criminal charges must be announced	
The American people deserve transparency and reassurance that federal law enforcement is actively investigating these matters	
We strongly support calls for immediate bipartisan investigations by Congress—this requires the full attention of the exec. & leg. branches	
We also call on @LorettaLynch to publicly confirm if a criminal investigation of Russian interference is underway: http://bit.ly/2hpxN6p 	
We are calling for a National Intelligence Estimate from @ODNIgov to be publicly released by Jan 20–the American people deserve the truth
