The Republican budget cuts $473 billion from Medicare and $1 TRILLION from Medicaid. That’s outrageous!pic.twitter.com/lNuPXnmxFU

It's now important that we work on a bipartisan basis to find solutions that lower health care costs and improve care.	
Because of these actions, the Republican attempts to take away health care from millions of Americans failed tonight!	
Over the past few months, so many people in Michigan shared their stories, made phone calls, and spoke out against the Republican bill.	
Every person deserves to know what we are voting on tonight. Republicans need to show us their health care bill!	
We as Democrats want to work together to lower costs - especially the outrageous cost of prescription drugs!	
Every single Republican health care proposal leads to higher costs and less coverage!

I wish we were talking about lowering prescription drug and out-of-pocket costs for Michigan families, instead of this terrible bill.	
As I told @DevinScillian this weekend on @Local4News, health care is personal, not political.pic.twitter.com/4bsaC258hC	
This is yet another reason why this bill is bad for Michigan families and why I’m working to defeat it.	
Given the terrible water crisis, this is not something #Flint families should have to worry about	#Flint
Buried in the #Trumpcare bill is yet another blow to Michigan: it could leave thousands of children & pregnant moms in #Flint w/o insurance.	#Trumpcare #Flint

The Trump Admin must immediately release the study they have been blocking so we can permanently stop the Asian carp!	
I was just informed that a live Silver carp was found ONLY 9 miles from Lake Michigan. This is very alarming!	
Protections like maternity care, prescription drugs, mental health, even a visit to the ER would all end because of #Trumpcare	#Trumpcare

ICYMI: Last night, I spoke about efforts to repeal our health care behind closed doors. GOP must #ShowUsTheBill.https://youtu.be/V-PERHeQRI0 	#ShowUsTheBill
It’s time for Republicans to show us the bill!	
Let’s focus on lowering the outrageous cost of prescription drugs and out of pocket costs.	
Republicans are hiding their bill because they know it’s a bad deal for the American people and Michigan families.	
And if you’re a senior whose rates are going to skyrocket, you have a right to know what’s in the bill.	
If you’re a woman who will be charged more for insurance, you have a right to know what’s in the bill.	
If you have cancer and won’t be able to get coverage, you have a right to know what’s in the bill.	
Republicans have a health care bill, but they won’t let us see it. They’re letting the Trump Admin see it, but not the American public.	
Tune in now - I'm speaking on the Senate Floor about the Republican health care bill.

Under the House Republican plan, insurance companies won't have to cover prescription drugs, maternity care, mental health and more.	
Their plan removes patient protections so insurance companies could once again charge people more if they have a preexisting condition.
