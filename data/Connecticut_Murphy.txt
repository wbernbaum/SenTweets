7/ Lift cap on Medicaid funding for Puerto Rico - federal underpayments to PR weakened economy, made Maria's impact worse. Time to remedy.	
6/ Extend 26 wk limit on Disaster Unemployment benefits - entire ag economy is ruined, cities devastated. Rebuild will take more than 6 mo.	
5/ Quicken food assistance by using the Disaster SNAP program - fastest way to get nutrition to thousands of hungry kids and parents.	
4/ Dramatically expand military personnel count in Puerto Rico. Problem right now isn't money - it's man power to clear roads, rebuild, etc.	
2/ Attach supplemental relief funds to must-pass FAA reauthorization bill this week. FEMA disaster money runs out in a few weeks. Why wait?

ACA money doesn't go to state governments. It's attached to individuals. "State flexibility" robs patients to give money to politicians.	
New Trumpcare "state flexibility" = stealing money that now goes to patients and giving it to state politicians to spend instead.	
This is a lie. A horrible knowing fabrication. The bill is intentionally constructed to force states to drop this protection.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/910641701064204288 …

The latest version of Trumpcare is the meanest one yet. Let me explain why.pic.twitter.com/VGkl8uUD8r	
6/ #GrahamCassidy FORCES states to drop preexisting condition protection. Not a matter of opinion. Incontrovertible fact.	#GrahamCassidy
1/ There is no "he said/she said" on whether new version of Trumpcare ends protections for people with preexisting conditions. It does.

If you're a Republican who says you're concerned w potential Medicaid cuts & u vote for #GrahamCassidy, you've been lying. It GUTS Medicaid.	#GrahamCassidy
7/ Bottom line: #GrahamCassidy, written in secret, hurts millions, makes every problem in the health care system worse not better.	#GrahamCassidy
6/ Even if states wanted to keep preexisting condition protections, they can't bc #GrahamCassidy gets rid of individual mandate.	#GrahamCassidy
5/ Massive funding cuts to states. $4 billion to my little state of CT by 10 year mark. States will either slash programs or raise taxes.	
4/ Premiums go up for everyone. 20% in first year alone. Gets way worse after that if you are 50+ or making under 400% of poverty.	
3/ Medicaid expansion vanishes. Millions will lose insurance, including loads of disabled and children. Many will die without care.	
1/ #GrahamCassidy eliminates protections for people who are or ever have been sick. GONE. Insurers back to denying coverage for the sick.	#GrahamCassidy

Just stopped on roadside to read @POTUS remarks. I nearly threw up. An American President offering a defense of white supremicists. My god.	
Dominate issue today as I walk across CT is health care. People waited for me on roadside for hours to tell why ACA repeal would hurt them.	
By and large, people I talk to as I walk across CT don't like Trump. But they talk issues, not scandals.	
fwiw, people I talk to during #WalkCT are talking about education, health care, taxes. Not Scaramucci, Mueller, Bannon.	#WalkCT

North Korea is the hardest problem out there. No obvious solution. But if a path exists, hard to find it w gutted diplomatic leadership.	
Why are we worried about Trump's military threats? Bc he's surrounded by advisors trained in military, not diplomatic solutions to crises.	
Trump knew NKorea would be a problem. Yet he intentionally keeps vacant EVERY diplomatic position that is relevant to solving this crisis.	
I'm worried about Trump's bellicosity on NKorea. I'm more worried that he has ZERO senior people who know how to solve crises like this.	
A President w no diplomatic experience chose a Sec of State w no diplomatic experience who chose not to hire anyone w diplomatic experience.

Last night proved, once again, that there is no anxiety or sadness or fear you feel right now that cannot be cured by political action.	
I ran into John McCain as we walked underground to the Senate for the final vote. Someday I'll get to tell my grandkids what he said to me.	
Reports of democracy's death may have been slightly exaggerated.	
Enzi continues to be the only GOP Senator on the floor and he isn't talking about anything remotely connected to the bill. This is surreal.

Here we go. McConnell on the floor to unveil the mystery bill. I will be up first to start the argument against it.	
Anybody worried or writing about a "schism" in the Democratic Party should have been in our caucus on health care repeal tonight.	
Senate packs repeal bill w conservative priorities + Trump says he loves bill + House readies w martial law = THERE WILL BE NO CONFERENCE	
Details emerging on "skinny" bill. It's not skinny and it's not designed for conference. Looks like it's designed to pass Senate AND House.	
Oh my. I just read this. And I thought it was impossible for today to get more Lord of the Flies.http://www.newyorker.com/news/ryan-lizza/anthony-scaramucci-called-me-to-unload-about-white-house-leakers-reince-priebus-and-steve-bannon/amp …	
On the Senate floor. The look of shock on faces of my Democratic colleagues is hard to overstate. No one can believe that this is happening.	
Seriously, this is weapons grade bonkers. 3 Senators just announced they will vote for repeal only if assured it will never become law.

Circle logic: GOP says w/o mandate people will "choose" to be uninsured. But that's BECAUSE repealing mandate makes insurance unaffordable.	
Don't fall for GOP calling this "skinny repeal". 18M people losing insurance in one year isn't "skinny", it's a "humanitarian catastrophe."https://twitter.com/ddiamond/status/890356189585956875 …

I'm on the Senate floor right now talking about health care. It's not too late to stop this and work together on a bipartisan alternative.	
Years from now, you'll regret staying quiet today because you were "too busy". Call a Senator. Show up at their offices. It's go time - NOW.	
Today's vote on health care was a gut punch but I want to be clear - this is not over.pic.twitter.com/eZr6hFQtZQ	
5/ Bottom line, any Republican voting for a "stripped down bill" is voting to fast track the House repeal bill into law. Make them own this.	
1/ A "scaled back" repeal bill, just so Senate GOP can get to conference, equals unconditional surrender of Senate GOP to the House bill.	
Confirmed.https://twitter.com/seungminkim/status/889921792911052800 …	
Gut check time. If the House bill - or any variant of it - passes, thousands will go bankrupt or die. This is not hyperbole. This is real.	
While everyone obsesses over the threat to democracy coming from the White House, Senate Republicans are striking the most grievous blow.

8/ Finally, will there be a new CBO score, as required by Senate rules, on whatever Frankenstein monster bill emerges from the arm twisting?	
7/ Are there new provisions written or promises made over the weekend that we haven't seen? If so, will we see them before we vote on them?	
6/ Parliamentarian says you can't buy off Senators with state-specific funding. Are those sections (like for AK and LA) still in? Out?	
5/ Are we voting first on the House bill? The first Senate bill? The second Senate bill? A brand new bill? Asking for 99 friends.	
4/ Is the mysterious $200b "transitional" slush fund in the bill? Brand new idea invented out of thin air last week to buy off a few votes.	
3/ Is Cruz Amendment in there or not? That kind of matters to billions of Americans who are, or have ever been, sick. They would be screwed.	
2/ For starters, uh...how much does the bill cost? Versions of bill floating around are hundreds of billions different on deficit impact.	
1/ 48 hours away from a vote on a health care reform bill no one has seen. Let us count thy things that are still totally unknown.	
It is B-A-N-A-N-A-S that we're less than 48 hours away from a vote on reordering 1/5 of the U.S. economy & we don't know what's in the bill.

What matters this week? 1. GOP health care bill 2. GOP health care bill 3. GOP health care bill 4. Russia/Trump Jr. story	
There will still be lots of issues left to fight over. What benefit do we get by injecting so much instability into 1/5 of the U..S economy?	
Wouldn't it be good for America AND both parties if Ds and Rs jointly owned the system and health care stopped being a political football?	
Just imagine if GOP accepted our offer to work together & health care ceased being a political cudgel used only to pummel the other party.	
Families in Connecticut rely on the Affordable Care Act and the patient protections it provides. They are who I'm fighting for.https://twitter.com/connpost/status/883484372984266752 …

Hey GOP, I read your bill. It mandates insurance just like the ACA. Yours just does it in a meaner and crueler way.http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/07/republicans-new-line-health-care-bill-will-give-americans-freedom-to-go-uninsured/amp …

I want to thank everyone who shared their stories with me. I am going to fight this disaster of a bill with everything that I’ve got.	
This is a fraction of the stories I’ve received from people across the state of Connecticut. This bill is bad news for the families I serve	
“Under Trumpcare with an age tax and a new law that allows insurance companies to punish older Americans, her insurance will soar.”	
“MS isn't a disease I could have prevented. Cuts to Medicaid will make it harder for me to afford the care I need.”	
Katherine from Simsbury - “I have multiple sclerosis and my MS treatment alone is now almost $20,000 a month.”	
“I didn’t ask for cancer. Not a day goes by that I wish I didn’t have to fight this. Now, I have to fight for the right to health care.”	
Angela from New Canaan - “I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in 2015 at the age of 49.”	
Isabelle from Unionville - “Before I had my second son, Rylan, I never thought about how my insurance plan worked. I didn’t need to.”	
“I’m afraid I won’t be able to access life-sustaining care for myself and my son. I don’t want him to suffer like I did before the ACA.”	
Pamela from Ellington - “I have a potentially life-threatening genetic condition called Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) and so does my son.”	
“The Affordable Care Act saved my life. Without it, I’d probably be dead, within months.”	
“Health care is the number one priority in my life, it’s more important than income, more important than anything else.”	
Jon from Meriden - “I was born with cystic fibrosis, a disease that causes my lungs to fill with fluid.”	
To repeal without replacement and guaranteed patient protections is to deny our most vulnerable and most promising the chance of survival	
Bonnie from West Hartford - “My daughter Leslie was diagnosed with a non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma when she was just 22 years old.”	
“Slashing Medicaid would be devastating to my family. I'm a working parent and I only want to be able to care for my children.”	
"Knowing my son can get the meds he needs to keep him healthy, alive and able to move is a blessing. It's something I do not want to lose."	
Kamera from Stamford - “I am a single mom to 2 children. My youngest has a rare genetic disease called Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome.”	
“These services are thanks to Medicaid. I'm afraid this bill will hurt his continued special education services which he needs very much.”	
“He will be 8 and thanks to speech pathologists, occupational therapists and special education he has come a long way.”	
Erin from Mashantucket - “My son has autism and has been receiving services through the public school system.”	
“Surgeries I underwent potentially saved my life & didn't bankrupt our family. No one should choose btwn life-saving surgery & bankruptcy.”	
“If the Republican bill passes, my preexisting condition - since birth! - could no longer be covered.”	
Kristen from New Haven - “I am BRCA positive, and though I have taken preventive action, the risk is still there.”	
“But no one should have to go through that in order to fight sickness with their loved ones.”	
Melinda from Middletown - “My mom passed away almost 5 years ago from ALS. She fought for 10 years because of Medicare.”	
“I rely on the ACA & I can’t afford the increases I would pay under the GOP plan. Anyone can get older or sicker.” It shouldn’t be this way.	
Julia from Westport - “I’m over age 55. When the recession hit, I got laid off like a lot of Americans”	
“I’m 62 years old and I know that I won’t be able to afford the 800% premium increase that would affect me under the new Republican plan.”	
“I went back to college on my own to re-train and finally climbed back out of the hole. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without the ACA”	
Paula from Glastonbury - “I had insurance through my husband’s company.” He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died 8 weeks later.	
“Until the Affordable Care Act, she was never able to get a quality health insurance plan because of her pre-existing condition.”	
Jim from Stonington - “My daughter was born with a heart valve problem that required surgery when she was only 2 days old.”	
“I have always worked hard, at my job and as a caregiver. I did it all with little to no help. ACA was there to help me when I needed it.”	
Gretchen from Winstead - “I worked as an LPN for many yrs here in CT. You may think nurses don't have to worry about healthcare, but we do.”	
“Continuous care is important. Lapses in policy for people like me is the difference between life or death. Period.”	
“If Medicaid gets stripped, I could die. Medicaid ensures my testing, medication, and helps me monitor this very difficult disease."	
Paul from Litchfield - “I have a rare interstitial lung disease. I was in the hospital for 48 days, very ill and in critical condition.”	
“Imagine having to choose between keeping your home or getting life-saving surgery. We do not want to return to those bad old days.”	
Betsy from Litchfield - “Without the Affordable Care Act, I would not have health insurance at all due to my pre-existing condition.”	
I’ll be tweeting stories all day from families in Connecticut who shared what it means to have health care & what it would mean to lose it.	
Senate Republicans need to hear the real life stories about what this bill would do to families. So that's what I'm going to do today.	
But clearly, these numbers aren’t enough to move many of my Republican colleagues who are still supporting this dumpster fire of a bill.	
It’s no secret that the numbers behind the Republican health care bill are bad. 22 million will lose insurance & premiums will go up.	
Recently @RepEsty & I intro'd our bill to create a National Green Bank which will create jobs & help the environmenthttp://www.courant.com/politics/hc-national-green-bank-20170621-story.html …	
Cuts to Medicaid could be devastating for Connecticut seniors in nursing homes.http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Health-bill-could-present-nursing-home-challenge-11243230.php …	
I want to know - how would #Trumpcare impact your family? Tweet me your story and I'll be sharing them here later this week.	#Trumpcare
If Trumpcare passes, 200,000 people in CT could lose insurance. How can you look people in the eye & tell them you voted to take their care?

This is the best summary out there from a Senator of the GOP position on their health care bill.https://twitter.com/aliceollstein/status/879458283475619840 …	
CBO confirms (again) that ACA is not in a "death spiral". Under current law 22m more people will have insurance by 2026 than under GOP bill.	
CBO confirms this bill is a humanitarian catastrophe waiting to happen. My god, why would you choose to do this to your country?https://twitter.com/KatyTurNBC/status/879434488723390464 …	
Still a crippling cut to Medicaid. Since Medicaid covers lots of disabled & sick people, its cost growth is much higher than medical CPI.https://twitter.com/costareports/status/879049049713848321 …	
Prepping for the CBO report, remember Senate GOP's consistent complaint that ACA still left too many uncovered, and they could do better.

I have an awesome way for people to stop suffering a broken health care system, Mr. President. Stop your relentless campaign to break it.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/878717095701336064 …	
3/ This may seem in the weeds, but it's so important. GOP is hiding the worst Medicaid cuts in years 11, 12, 13 and hoping CBO stays quiet.	
2/ I sent CBO a follow up letter today stressing that data on coverage losses outside 10 yr window must come simultenous to main CBO report.	
1/ As ranking Dem on Approps Subcommittee overseeing CBO, I asked if they would score insurance losses outside 10 yr window. They said yes.

Health insurance lobbyists get briefed on the secret bill before Democratic Senators or the American public. What a sham.https://twitter.com/petersullivan4/status/877659805309120513 …	
4/ Endgame for people w preexisting conditions is the same: they don't get coverage for their condition. They get sick or go bankrupt.	
3/ Without essential benefits rule, insurers just won't offer someone w mental illness a plan that covers mental illness.	
2/ Doesn't matter if bill says insurers can't charge sick people more if it allows insurers to not cover treatments for sick people.	
1/ Important note for tommorrow: if GOP repeal bill ends essential benefits protection, it also ends preexisting conditions protection.

2/ The Muslim ban isn't a strategy. It repeats Europe's mistake by blaming and marginalizing Muslims, encouraging radicalism.

The hypocrisy of our "red lines" - our refugee ban locks Syrians into their dystopia, our support to Saudis helps cause famine in Yemen.	
Whatever the merits of a military strike on Syria, there is no doubt the Constitution demands it be congressionally authorized.	
I voted no on Gorsuch. "Originalism" isn't mainstream - it's just right wing cover for bending the Constitution to corporate interests.	
No one should be surprised by this rules change. GOP treatment of Garland made clear their priority is politics, not tradition or precedent.	
It's time to revolutionize the higher ed in America. That's why I joined @BernieSanders to introduce College for Allhttp://bit.ly/2nYzSZA 	
(a) Trump opposed bombing Assad in 2013 (b) Now says Obama should have bombed Assad (c) But refuses to bomb Assad. The world's head spins.

It’s outrageous that we’re still debating equal pay for equal work in 2017. Time for Congress to wake up & pass the Paycheck Fairness Act	
If GOP changes the rules this week, their legacy will be the shattering of Senate tradition/precedent - first for Garland, then for Gorsuch.	
I feel like a broken record, but pls read this - we are plunging Yemen into famine - on purpose. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-hodeidah-yemen-famine_us_58a88970e4b037d17d28610b?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004 … via @HuffPostPol	
At least their plan to leave ACA in place but undermine and sabotage it is getting more transparent.https://twitter.com/mikedebonis/status/848985462945480704 …	
My no on Gorsuch isn't payback for Garland, but any Republican lecturing us on obstructionism this week get the Gold Medal of Hypocrisy.	
We need to rein in the influence of dark money and special interests. Gorsuch's appointment will move us in the wrong direction.

Democrats have ideas on how to improve health care, but instead you plan to sabotage the system as retribution for the failure of your bill.	
Mr. President, no party "owns" the health care system. But your party controls all of government so its success or failure is up to you.	
Gee, wonder why? Maybe bc u wrote the bill in secret w no Democrats. Maybe the 24m losing insurance. Maybe the huge cost spikes. Dunno.https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/845417733957304321 …	
FYI for all the focus on the Freedom Caucus, what brought down this bill were moderate Rs who bailed bc of grassroots pressure back home.

(6) Last rant, for now. If you're older, your premiums go WAY up. GOP plan guts premium protections for older consumers.	
(5) Oh, and Medicaid expansion is effectively GONE. Millions and millions lose coverage, start using ERs again for health care. Others die.	
(4) Mandatory benefits are repealed. So even if you CAN get insurance, it doesn't have to cover ANYTHING. Out of pocket expenses skyrocket.	
(3) Coverage mandates and penalties only work if you make insurance affordable. GOP plan cuts subsidies so much that penalty is unworkable.	
(2) It gets worse. When u can't afford your premiums bc the tax credit is too small, you get a huge penalty when you try to sign up again.	
(1) You get a couple thousand bucks to help u buy insurance. That's it. If u aren't rich or healthy, u won't be able to afford anything.

It's time to start treating #gunviolence like the public health crisis it is - one that kills 30,000 people every yrhttp://n.pr/2j59hEQ 	#gunviolence
Just keep repeating 3 promises Trump/GOP made on ACA repeal: 1) no gap btwn repeal & replacement (2) no one loses coverage (3) costs decline	
Repealing the ACA affects everyone - not just people who get insurance on the exchanges:http://cnnmon.ie/2iBbFqx

Good guys with guns almost never stop bad guys with guns. It's a lie. A myth. And that's why Trump applies it to everyone except himself.	
Trump's rallies are gun free bc he KNOWS that last night could have been deadly if everybody was armed when someone yelled "Gun!".	
Just a reminder that Trump wants to end gun free zones EXCEPT for anyplace where he is (his rallies, his resorts, for starters).

If this election comes down to one state w a recount, then of course Trump shouldn't concede. But that's not what he's talking about.	
History lesson: Gore didn't "contest" the 2000 election. It was a mandatory recount. When the count was final, Gore conceded.	
The coin of the realm in a democracy is the peaceful transition of power. Voters get this. That's why this debate is a disaster for Trump.	
Donald Trump is doing a great Alec Baldwin impression right now. #wrong	#wrong
This stubborn awful, easy-to-disprove lie that Obama and Clinton pulled US troops out of Iraq. BUSH signed the agreement, not Obama.	
Clinton consistently and rightly makes the point that what ISIS wants is more American troops in Syria and Iraq.	
Just step back and appreciate the madness of this - a nominee for US President saying he won't respect the outcome of the election. Unreal.	
. @realDonaldTrump runs twice as good a campaign for Putin than he does for himself.	
Awesome @HillaryClinton! Not afraid to take on the gun lobby, stand up for common sense changes in our gun laws. Love it.	
FYI @realDonaldTrump, Chicago is the reason we need national background checks. Illegal guns in Chicago come from Indiana.

btw Trump's health care answer was a total lie. You cannot repeal ACA and magically keep the preexisting condition provision. Impossible.	
The enthusiasm and urgency of @HillaryClinton to get background checks into this debate tells you how much has changed in America on guns.	
Credit to @HillaryClinton for promising not to use U.S. ground troops in Syria. ISIS is dying for U.S. troops in Syria, and she knows it.	
Martha Raddatz trying to tutor Trump on foreign policy in real time. In the middle of a presidential debate. This is unprecedented.	
OH MY GOD. Russia is not killing ISIS, Donald. They are facilitating the slaughter of civilians. This is Putin's talking points on stage.	
So this Syria Q is REALLY important. This isn't play. And Trump's answer is his most rambling, incoherent yet. So, so scary.	
If you don't think Trump wants to mirror Putin as President, then you didn't hear him threaten to jail his political rival if elected.

Watch for Rs avoiding saying they won't vote for Trump by simply calling for him to step down (and then voting for him when he doesn't).
