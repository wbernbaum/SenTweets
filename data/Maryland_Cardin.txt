Rep. #Price is an interesting choice, as he does not even share President-Elect Trump's campaign promise to protect #Medicare for seniors.	#Price #Medicare
I'll be asking Rep #Price some tough questions about how he plans to run @HHSGov. Must protect tens of millions who depend on ACA healthcare	#Price
Mr. Trump must enact a true #blindtrust just as every other president has done. No knowledge of or communication about businesses. Period.	#blindtrust
Announcing his plans beside his children leaves many questions as to whether Mr. Trump/his lawyers understand the meaning of a #blindtrust.	#blindtrust
While I'm encouraged by Mr. Trump's initial response to calls for a #blindtrust, the devil will be in the details. https://sen.gov/9038 	#blindtrust
Re: his business dealings, Mr. Trump may say “trust me." But let us remember what John Adams said: "We are a government of laws, not men."pic.twitter.com/cAbrIdFYFX	
Every President from George Washington to Barack Obama has taken pains to avoid even the appearance of impropriety re: their investments.	
If Mr. Trump doesn't enact a #blindtrust for his businesses, I'm very concerned he'll be violating the Constitution. https://sen.gov/62ZP 	#blindtrust
This is not an esoteric argument about rules. This is about a historically bipartisan, Constitutional requirement. #BlindTrustpic.twitter.com/NulRWk2pPm	#BlindTrustpic

My resolution is intended to prevent a Constitutional crisis or misunderstanding regarding Mr. Trump's assets. http://sen.gov/O18X 	
Mr. Trump should convert assets to conflict-free holdings or blind trusts to ensure compliance w/ the #EmolumentsClause of the Constitution.	#EmolumentsClause
On Monday I will introduce a resolution asking President-elect Trump to comply w/ Constitution regarding his assets. https://sen.gov/O18X

I've written to @potus to take action against #Russia. There is still time to hold them accountable. US must respond to their aggression.	#Russia
#Russia's interference in democratic institutions have extended to our own democratic elections. This warrants a fast, strong response.	#Russia
#Russia's targets go well beyond its own citizens. They've actively encouraged corruption in #Ukraine. This is not a Cold War, but a hot war	#Russia #Ukraine
Whether by MiG or mouse, #Russian global attacks require a comprehensive US response. My thoughts in @washingtonposthttps://sen.gov/1V2X 	#Russian

Hate cannot be the ruling force these next 4 years, and it certainly should not have an office in the West Wing. http://sen.gov/RZNP 	
If Mr. Trump is serious about uniting the country, he must start by surrounding himself with men and women of the highest character.
