Weve long turned the page on days when a boss could stand btwn a woman & her healthcare decisions – @POTUS' decision drags the US backwards.	
The GOP's partisan plan to repeal this deduction must be scrapped. They should start over w #TaxReform that truly benefits the middle class.	#TaxReform
It's crystal clear, the benefits of this deduction touch every state, every big city, every small town & municipality across the country.	
In 2015, 22% of New Mexicans took the State and Local Tax Deduction, and the average deduction was $7,091 #TrumpTax	#TrumpTax
Don’t believe me? Just look at these numbers & think about what a #TrumpTax would mean:	#TrumpTax
44 million Americans all across the country take the state & local tax deduction (~1/3 of all taxpayers) & they get $1Ks off their taxes.	
#Dreamers, we'll keep fighting until the #DreamAct becomes law. This is your home and you are #HereToStay.	#Dreamers #DreamAct #HereToStay
Rs & Ds called on the Administration to delay the #DACA renewal deadline, but roughly 48k haven't submitted their #DACA applications.	#DACA #DACA
I say to @POTUS come out & support a law to ban bump stocks, the modification used by the Las Vegas gunman to make his weapons automatic.	
To have the gall to complain about PR while proposing tax cuts for millionaires that will cost trillions is the height of hypocrisy.	
I don’t remember @POTUS telling Texas that they’d thrown our budget out of whack after Harvey. Or Florida after Irma.	
We will have to reckon with the fact that this man was able to assemble an arsenal of military-grade weapons.	
Today, we are filled with shock and horror, sadness and rage. And we are left with more questions than answers.	
My office has been talking to Dialysis companies, American Kidney Fund & HHS about emergency situation in #PuertoRico with Dialysis patients	#PuertoRico
We need an @FCC chair who believes in free & #OpenInternet & knows it is a tool for science, art, entrepreneurs -not just corporate profits.	#OpenInternet
Tomorrow, @SenateMajLdr will have the Senate vote for another 5 yr term for @FCC Chair Ajit Pai. I will vote w/ a resounding NO.	
We urge the GOP to pursue mainstream #taxreform that has fiscally responsible tax cuts for Americans who need it, not donors who demand it.	#taxreform
Rs & Ds used to agree on the Baker Rule: #taxreform must be revenue neutral, judged on its own merits. No dynamic scoring. No Fake Math.	#taxreform
So if you are a giant corporation or in the top 1% - the GOP has a #TaxReform plan for you. If you aren’t? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯	#TaxReform
Plain & simple: GOP #TaxReform the tax rate on the wealthiest from 39.6% to 35%. But for those working to make it to the middle class.	#TaxReform
In #TaxReform, @POTUS asks Rs, Ds & Is to come together for a pro-America tax code. One problem. Their plan is pro-the top 1% of-Americans	#TaxReform

Fighting to repeal health care while millions of Americans in #PuertoRico are struggling to find shelter is unconscionable.	#PuertoRico

Train delayed? Tweet @POTUS to support rail infrastructure programs like #Gateway so we have tunnels & rail systems that work for you.	#Gateway
Other low points: @POTUS agreeing w/ Putin to form a so called working group on cyber security; laughing tghr & mocking the free press.	
Instead of decisively confronting Putin head on, @POTUS seemed to acquiesce to his denial, opening the door for future Russian interference.	
As our Intel Community has unanimously concluded Putin deliberately interfered in our elections & sought to destabilize our democracy.	
Clearly the lowest moment of all was @POTUS' meeting with Vladimir Putin, on several counts.	
While a few good things came out of the G20 summit, overall it was an embarrassment to our country & our ideals.	
This will not fool the millions of people who will be harmed by #Trumpcarehttp://wapo.st/2u1KyuU 	#Trumpcarehttp
When every other non-partisan org says your plan is bad, you can either change the plan or make up fake numbers. #Trumpcarehttps://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/883476186990608385 …	#Trumpcarehttps
Giving equal credence to the US Intel Community's findings & Putin's assertion is a grave dereliction of duty & will only encourage Russia.	
. @POTUS had an obligation to bring up Russia’s interference in our election & to take the word of our Intel Community rather than Putin's.	
Working to compromise the integrity of our elections cannot & should not be an area where ‘agree to disagree’ is an acceptable conclusion.	
Only way to truly improve #healthcare is for the Trump admin to stop sabotaging marketplaces & for GOP to finally work in a bipartisan way.	#healthcare
Make no mistake, the @SenTedCruz amendment is a hoax. Under the guise of lowering premiums, it makes health care more expensive.	
Putin and his oligarch's corruption and fleecing of Russia and its people.	
Urge Putin to work to mitigate the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons program.	
Putin's threatening of NATO allies, including deployment of Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad.	
Putin's energy manipulation and coercion of our European partners and allies.	
In Syria, Putin's support to and cooperation with Assad regime, Iran, and Hezbollah. We stand with the Syrian people.	
Putin's support to Russian-led separatists in the Donbas & failure to comply w Minsk Agreemts. We stand w/ our Ukrainian brothers & sisters.	
Putin's interference in the elections of our European allies & partners. We stand with our friends in Europe.	
Putin's interference in our elections last yr. Attack on our democracy. House needs to pass Senate sanctions bill. https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf …	
It's baffling that @POTUS doesn't have a specific agenda for the Putin meeting. Here are the first few things that come to my mind:	
Woke to the terrible news that Officer Miosotis Familia was shot & killed in the Bronx overnight. God bless her family & the NYPD.

The Senate GOP's healthcare bill was supposed to lower premiums. The #CBOscore shows it sure doesn't lower them if you're 64.pic.twitter.com/QShKrvvkdi	#CBOscore
Senate GOP's bill is fundamentally a massive health care cut to give huge tax breaks to the rich. No wonder it won’t fix our hc problems.	
The CBO report should be the end of the road for Trumpcare. @SenateGOP should read it like a giant stop sign, urging them to turn back.	
The CBO score confirms #Trumpcare will lead to higher costs for less care & tens of mils of Americans will be left without health insurance.	#Trumpcare

W/ the Russia probe, Dir Comey felt that there was enough potential evidence that a special counsel was warranted. The contrast is telling.	
Dir Comey did not wish to see a special counsel in the Clinton case because he looked at the facts & determined there wasn’t a case for one.	
President Trump: if you disagree with anything Director Comey said today, play the tapes for all of America to hear.

Today, FCC chairman announced a dramatic step in the wrong direction for the future of the internet w/ his plans to unravel net neutrality.	
Very wealthy are doing pretty well. God bless 'em. But they dont need a tax break while working class Americans need help staying afloat.	
Today we'll hear @POTUS's tax plan. We'll look at it, but if gives a huge tax break to the very wealthy that won't pass muster w/ Democrats.

Until Pres Trump releases his full tax returns, a cloud of suspicion will remain & make it much harder to pass tax reform through Congress.

"Under congressional rules, though, money from one bill isn’t deployed to another." The White House is struggling w/ this concept.	
Step Three: use all of that "savings" to cut taxes for big corporations and the wealthy.	
Step Two: cut Medicaid and throw millions of children and seniors off their insurance.	
President Trump has finally told the American ppl the truth about TrumpCare. Its really a hidden special interest tax cut plan in 3 steps.

11 wks into his administration, we have seen nothing from Pres Trump on infrastructure, trade, or any other serious job-creating initiative.	
Disappointing #JobsReport is another example that despite Pres Trump’s populist rhetoric on jobs, he is prioritizing special interests.	#JobsReport
GOP chose to break the rules & as a result American’s faith in the integrity of SCOTUS & their trust in impartiality of the law will suffer.	
The GOP taking the #NuclearOption will make this body a more partisan place & I believe it will make the Supreme Court a more partisan place	#NuclearOption
Judge Gorsuch was unable to earn 60 votes. Now the GOP is about to change Senate rules to allow all SCOTUS noms to pass by majority vote.	
Past few wks, we Dems have given Judge Gorsuch a fair process – something Merrick Garland was denied. We came to the debate w/ open minds.	
Judge Gorsuch’s judicial philosophy will affect dozens of decisions that could have far-reaching consequences on the lives of avg Americans.	
We Democrats have principled reasons to vote against Judge Gorsuch: 1st he has instinctively favored corporate interests over avg Americans.	
The United States joins the world in condemning these savage attacks on the Syrian people. They are in our prayers.

SCOTUS has found that disabled students are entitled to substantially greater protections under fed law than Judge Gorsuch previously ruled.

If anyone doubts Judge Gorsuch could be an activist judge w/ strong consrvt views, eschewing interests of avg ppl, look how he was selected.	
The qualifications for Senate confirmation shouldn't be skillful evasion of questions, it's not how the hearing process is supposed to work.	
Judge Gorsuch’s testimony yesterday was replete with humble metaphors & homespun stories but pitifully short on substance.	
It’s not unreasonable for Senators to consider & question a nominee's ideology in cmte. But he should be willing to answer specific Qs.	
Senators know to ask general Qs to get a sense of a Judge’s philosophy. In our meeting, Judge Gorsuch refused to answer even those Qs.

This Admin seems to have less respect for the rule of law than any in recent memory & challenges the Constitution in unprecedented ways.	
SCOTUS justice must stand up to a Pres willing to bend the Constitution. Serious doubts on Judge Gorsuch’s ability to meet this standard.	
Gorsuch put corps over workers, been hostile toward women’s rights & been an ideolog. Skeptical that he can be a strong, independent Justice	
We also need a SCOTUS justice who will stand up to a President who has already shown a willingness to bend the Constitution.	
Now more than ever, we need a Justice who is independent, eschews ideology, who will preserve our democracy & protect fundamental rights.	
The American people need answers on exec orders from Sen Sessions. Jud Cmte shouldn’t proceed until we get them so I'll invoke the 2hr rule.	
The AG should pledge fidelity to the law & the Constitution not the WhiteHouse. The fact that this admin doesnt understand that is chilling.	
The American ppl should know exactly how ind. Sen Sessions plans to be when the WhiteHouse violates the law BEFORE the Senate votes on him.	
Firing of Sally Yates underscores how impt it is to have an Attorney General who'll stand up to the WhiteHouse when they violate the law.

Of course, all PEOTUS' nominees need a thorough investigation & questioning at their Senate hearings but Mr. Viola is up to the job.	
I've known Vinnie Viola for a over decade, and his dedication to the @USArmy is second to none.	
.@RepMickMulvaney you claim to be a true deficit hawk. Will you be consistent & oppose Trump's huge unpaid for tax breaks for the wealthy?	
. @SenateDems are already preparing ample questions for his hearing so the American people know EXACTLY where he stands.https://twitter.com/maxboot/status/809431014405799936 …	
Public servants, esp in the highest office must lead by example, pay fines, release taxes, recuse & divest from conflicts of interest.

Given our serious concerns, FR cmte members must have ample time to study Mr. Tillerson’s record & ask several rounds of questions.	
Senate Foreign Relations Cmte members on both sides will ask Mr. Tillerson tough questions on Russia, Putin & the Paris Climate Agreement.	
From his past w/ Putin & #Russia, to the future of #ParisAgreement, Mr. Tillerson has a lot of questions to answer in nomination hearings.	#Russia #ParisAgreement
American people deserve to know how & for what purpose #Russia manipulated our free & fair elections. Findings must be public to max extent.	#Russia
It will be impt at the end of bipartisan investigation into #Russian meddling that findings be shared with public.	#Russian
Investigation into cyber attacks must be bipartisan & include ALL relevant intel. We must find out how they happened & stop future attacks.	
We welcome @SenateMajLdr's support for a thorough bipartisan investigation into reports that Russia interfered with the 2016 election.	
Cyber security, especially in our elections, cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for our country.	
Joined @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @SenJackReed in call for bipartisanship & investigation into cyber attacks on the US by foreign govs.	
It’s irresponsible to support an #EPA nominee who puts polluters over clear water & air for the American people. I oppose #PollutingPruitt.	#EPA #PollutingPruitt

. @SenatorBaldwin's #BuyAmerica provision would help build US infrastructure w/ US steel. How can @HouseGOP oppose this obvious job creator?	#BuyAmerica
Fact: @HouseGOP plan harms American manufacturing. @SenateDems will fight to support #BuyAmerica & urge next admin to do same.	#BuyAmerica
The Fed gov’t & next @usedgov Sec have a responsibility to ensure every American child has access to quality public ed. I won’t forget it.	
Public ed is the key to keeping the US a leader in medicine, tech, manufacturing. We cannot divert resources from our children’s future.	
In NY, we celebrate #WorldAIDSDay by remembering those who died, those who were denied care, those who were shunned, bullied & beaten.	#WorldAIDSDay
Nominating Rep Price @HHSGov Sec like asking a fox to guard the hen house; risks seniors, women, people w/ disabilities' healthcare access.	
Medicare is one of the most successful govt programs ever created. To GOP colleagues considering this path, @SenateDems say: make our day.	
The GOP's ideological & visceral hatred of govt could deny millions of seniors the care they need. This attack on Medicare will not stand.	
Students thrive when we invest in public education, this Ed Sec pick threatens that. More resources should be given to public ed, not less.
