My favorite button from all the meetings, rallies and protests this week about the Senate GOP healthcare bill:pic.twitter.com/djiQU05rhN	
This is cruel and unbecoming of a 10 year old, not to mention the President of our nation. Enough! Demonstrate dignity or leave the office.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/880410114456465411 …

May we remember folk in prison are still part of our society; we are defined by how we treat them and how we offer them hope for redemption.	
From the warden to the incarcerated women who advocated for issues of no direct benefit to them, today I saw the power of tireless love.	
Again, I am grateful for those - especially at today's prison - who pour their heart into their work and affirm human dignity.	
America is paying too high a price for a broken criminal justice system that harms too much & helps too little. We must all demand better.	
Women face unique challenges in prison. Thanks to insights from the warden, staff & women I listened to, I'll step up my fight for reform.	
We must also do a better job focusing on the reality that so many of the people we incarcerate, especially women, are survivors of traumas.	
Our criminal justice system is broken, you see it up close visiting prisons; from excessive sentencing to lack of resources for reentry.	
I'm grateful to the professionals who work there - corrections officers, medical staff & more - who do hard & difficult work for our nation.	
Just finished a visit to another Federal Prison. I visited for many reasons including to learn more about issues facing incarcerated women.

Today isn't an end of US leadership on global climate issues; instead it is a rallying cry for us to double down in this urgent fight.	
In a few days, from his G7 meetings to his Rose Garden speech, Trump has moved us from a position of global leadership to reckless isolation	
Trump is wrong: It's not economy vs environment or America vs the world. It's future vs past; progress & opportunity vs retreat & surrender.	
Pres Trump's Decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement is a vicious blow to American leadership in the world and to our future.

This is the key question:https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/837127883797704704 …	
There are many legitimate reasons. Sessions should have disclosed it but didn't. Why? He is compromised. Independent investigation now.https://twitter.com/cocaccola7/status/837167816222597120 …	
No. Read his testimony. He's "explaining" now. But if what he says is true, why not disclose that to the committee? Why hide it?https://twitter.com/dkennylee_lee/status/837167848090976257 …	
He has responded but for the integrity of the investigation he should recuse himself AND join our call for an independent special council.https://twitter.com/justkimonline/status/837168119118446595 …	
I and other Senate colleagues have been quick to call this out. We will continue to lead in the fight for independent investigations. https://twitter.com/cloughleyryan/status/837168188903215104 …

Thank you. I'm proud of my testimony against Sessions and it is kind of you to say it inspired you. Thank you.https://twitter.com/jbhumphe/status/837157684663173120 …	
At the very least his testimony was (intentionally or not) misleading. His ability to independently investigate is irreversibly compromised.https://twitter.com/djtrumpresident/status/837157707358547969 …	
Sessions testified that he had no contact with Russian officials. We now know he did. We can not rely on him for an objective investigation.https://twitter.com/steminist13/status/837157727050711040 …

A strong performance by Clinton. She is the clear winner tonight. 20 days until a HRC election victory and a victory for our Nation. #debate	#debate
Trump, who has said crass, demeaning, vulgar things about women, calls HRC a "Nasty Woman." He can't help but reveal his ugly truth #debate	#debate
Trump says he'll improve GDP but gives no details how he'll do it. Like a peacock promising to fly, lots of flash no hope for flight #debate	#debate
Minutes left in the debate and no questions about pressing criminal justice issues in our nation. #disappointing #debate	#disappointing #debate
Clinton is at her best tonight: patient, poised and professional. Giving Trump room to flounder & hitting him with precision rebuts #debate	#debate

When billionaire Trump says "We're entitled." with cavalier bravado about not paying taxes it is an insult to middle class who do. #debate	#debate
Trump denies that money from his foundation was used for campaign contributions and oddly says he raised the American flag #Debate	#Debate
HRC gives powerful answer on fitness: Trump has shown us who he is with his demeaning of women, time for America to show who we are #debates	#debates
"On day I was in the Situation Room helping to bring Osama to justice you were hosting the Celebrity Apprentice." Clinton on Trump #debate	#debate
"There is only one of us on this stage who has shipped jobs to Mexico." Clinton on Trump. #Debate	#Debate
If Trump is so concerned about our jobs going overseas why does he make all of his Trump products there? #BeTheChange #Debate	#BeTheChange #Debate
Wallace wrong in his conclusion: stimulus lead to slow growth. Clinton points out Obama efforts saved USA from a financial free fall #debate	#debate
Trump makes mistake in debates of re-litigating past exchanges, gaining nothing, instead of answering current questions persuasively #debate	#debate

Clinton pounding Trump on Putin and clearly winning this round. Amazing Trump actually seems to be a Putin apologist. #debate	#debate
It's not perfect but I give some credit to Wallace, so far this debate is more disciplined and focused than others. #debate	#debate
"Bad Hombres" is kind of cavalier language + context Trump uses that's devoid of stature & grace, more taunting than statesmanship #Debate	#Debate
In last questions Trump spending more time exaggerating Clinton's position or using fear laced language than discussing policy/ideas #debate	#debate
Hillary so very strong when discussing the right of women to make their own (often profoundly difficult) health care decisions. #debate	#debate
Guns used in crimes in Chicago come significantly from outside of the city and from states with lax gun laws. Background checks help #debate	#debate
