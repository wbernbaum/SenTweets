We cannot let politicians in Washington, with taxpayer-funded healthcare, pull the rug out from under Ohio families and communities.	
According @CBO, the House GOP plan - nearly identical to #GrahamCassidy - would cause premiums to go up an average of about 20% next year.	#GrahamCassidy
And whether or not you're on Medicaid, you're looking at a premium increase next year if #GrahamCassidy becomes law.	#GrahamCassidy
Also hurt: 71,000 veterans in Ohio who get their coverage through Medicaid, and 150,000 Ohioans getting opioid treatment.	
So who gets hurt by these Medicaid cuts? To start: 973,000 children in Ohio who rely on Medicaid for their health insurance	
It cuts a net $20 BILLION from Ohio. For every $1 OH spends on Medicaid on average, 63¢ comes from federal $ that #GrahamCassidy would cut.	#GrahamCassidy
So-called right-to-work laws give corporations the ability to trample workers’ rights and dismantle unions. I refuse to let that happen.

Instead of ripping away these health benefits, we should be working together to lower costs and make healthcare work better for everyone.	
10. Pediatric services - it should be as easy & inexpensive as possible for our kids - like Benjamin from Akron - to get the care they need.pic.twitter.com/e1dLWkPao6	
9. Preventive and wellness services like screenings and vaccines - cost shouldn't prevent people from keeping themselves healthy.	
8. Lab services - to make sure you're properly diagnosed, & all the boxes are checked. Without insurance, this can amount to thousands of $.	
7. Rehab services & devices - sometimes, a diagnosis & medication isn't enough to fully recover, and your full treatment should be covered.	
6. Prescription drugs - it's no secret drug prices are getting higher & higher, and insurance is a lifeline for so many who depend on them.	
5. Mental health services & addiction treatment - for people like Brittany, who said Medicaid was critical to her recovery from addiction.pic.twitter.com/iwK3L2o6at	
4. Care for women when they're pregnant - maternity care and treatment through labor and post-delivery, and care for newborns.	
2. Emergency services - because no one should worry about whether or not they can afford care in a crisis.	
1. Outpatient care you receive outside of a hospital - like routine checkups, screenings, and other regular procedures.

In my state, 200,000 families are getting treatment for opioid addiction. What happens to them with the Trump budget? -SBpic.twitter.com/fzeQ4P8bBm	
The House bill will drive up costs, kick Ohioans off their insurance & leave folks who have asthma or cancer unable to even purchase a plan.	
Anyone with common sense knows that paying more for less is a bad deal.	
6. It zeros out the Appalachian Regional Commission - a slap in the face to rural Ohio.	
5. It slashes nearly 70% in the public housing repair budget, which would leave more Ohioans exposed to mold, lead, & other health hazards.	
4. It reduces workforce training funding by 40%, & eliminates the Economic Development Administration & Manufacturing Extension Partnership.	
3. It pulls the rug out from under our fight to combat the opioid crisis.	
2. It cuts the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).	
1. It ELIMINATES the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative – threatening clean water and good jobs along Lake Erie.	
Budgets are about priorities. What does this budget tell us about the White House’s priorities?	
Horrific news out of Manchester. Thinking of everyone involved & grateful for the first responders on the scene.
