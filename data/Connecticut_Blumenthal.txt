Women deserve the freedom to access cost-free contraception at their own discretion - not at the whim of an employer.	
Gutting ACA contraception mandate is another backward step by an Admin apparently unconcerned w/ women's financial & physical well-being.	
Repealing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act will unlock the doors of justice and give gun violence victims their day in court.	
I am introducing a bill to repeal the absurd sweetheart deal that blocks victims from seeking legal action against gun manufacturers.	
Unlike virtually all other goods manufacturers, the gun industry cannot be sued by consumers harmed by their products. That is outrageous.	
Hopeful banning bump stocks will be the first of many commonsense steps Congress takes to curb the scourge of gun violence.

Bump stocks essentially circumvent strict and accepted laws against automatic weapons. What excuse can there be for their continued sale?	
We should be furious that bump stocks - which enable near-automatic rates of fire - are sold in the United States.	
Proud to join @SenFeinstein & many others on bill to ban sale of bump stocks - carnage force multipliers that have no place in our society.	
I thank everyone who has spoken up for commonsense gun violence prevention measures. Your voices of reason are more vital than ever.	
We have it in our power to curb gun violence and save lives. It is that simple. Congress is complicit each day it fails to act.	
Questioned Secretary Mattis today on the urgent need for a greater @DeptofDefense role in Puerto Rico relief efforts.	
We cannot grow numb to the nightmare Puerto Rico & USVI are facing. I'll fight for every ounce of relief they deserve - whatever it takes.	
Americans everywhere have rallied behind Puerto Rico. Their inspiring response must be matched with unparalleled federal action.	
Recovering from this crisis requires a long-term Marshall Plan to rebuild Puerto Rico's infrastructure and restore vital networks.	
We cannot forget the humanitarian crisis facing millions of Americans - on their second week without access to clean water, power or fuel.

Never thought I would see cameras & live coverage banned from White House press room. This pattern of secrecy is antithetical to our values.

Mr. President - your calling Russia investigation a "charade" shows exactly why we need a special prosecutor independent of you.

Joining @AC360 in a few minutes to discuss today’s #Russia hearing, #SallyYates testimony, and what needs to happen next.	#Russia #SallyYates
Naming a special prosecutor is vital to delivering the answers and accountability Americans deserve. Time to learn who knew what and when.	
White House officials at highest level could be witnesses or even targets - stakes are too high for anything but a fully independent probe.	
But we do know this: Only an independent investigation, led by special prosecutor, can hold Russian meddlers & Trump associates accountable.	
Yet despite several warnings to WH over Flynn’s vulnerability to Russian blackmail, weeks passed before his ouster. We still don't know why.
