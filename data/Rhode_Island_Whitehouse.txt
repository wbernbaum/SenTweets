The American people must have confidence that the investigation will be free of political interference by the White House or anyone else.	
I agree with @SenSchumer that the Senate should be briefed ASAP by AG and Dep AG, separately, as to the facts of Comey’s termination.	
As a former US Attorney & member of the Judiciary Cte w/ oversight of DOJ and FBI, I am determined to see that the truth is pursued.	
We need a thorough, independent investigation of Russia’s meddling in our election that’s beyond the reach of political interference.	
Yates warned WH of compromise by Russians, got fired. Comey fired. McCord leaving DOJ National Security Division. A lot of bodies.
