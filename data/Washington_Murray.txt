No member of Congress, no matter political affiliation, should stand in the way of a thorough investigation. Neither should the President.

From everything we heard & all the questions that still remain, it's clear Betsy DeVos is the wrong choice to lead the Dept of Education.

Betsy DeVos doesn't have the experience, skills, understanding, or vision to lead @usedgov at a time when it is more important than ever.
