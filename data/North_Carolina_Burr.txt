His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the Bureau and the nation.	
Dir. Comey has been more forthcoming w/ information than any FBI Director I can recall in my tenure on the congressional intel committees.	
In my interactions w/ the Director and w/ the Bureau under his leadership, he & the FBI have always been straightforward with our Committee.	
His dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.	
I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order.

My prayers are with the families of the fallen police officers in Iowa. We must always support those who put their lives on the line for us.	
Obamacare’s drastic Medicare cuts mean less access to life-saving cancer treatments, especially in rural NC:http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-medicare-experiment-with-a-grim-prognosis-1463950252 …	
We should allow this to go through the complete processes, this time including all of the emails on Clinton’s server.	
The American people deserve a full accounting of Secretary Clinton’s practices and a complete picture of her actions as Secretary of State.

It’s time to do the right thing and allow these vets to keep their bonuses. If not, Congress will fix this problem:http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/congress-react-california-guard-bonuses …

We need to expand access to quality healthcare by empowering individuals to make their own healthcare decisions http://www.nsjonline.com/article/2016/09/burr-obamacare-is-imploding …	
Sadly, many North Carolina counties will have only one #Obamacare insurer. Also, NC premiums are rising nearly 25% on average.	#Obamacare
The heartaches of Obamacare don't have to be the norm. There's a better way to improve & modernize healthcare -- @SenThomTillis	
Unfortunately, instead of working across the aisle to fix this mess, @POTUS and congressional Democrats are in denial -- @SenThomTillis

It is our understanding that these conversations are being reviewed further, as they should be.	
State Department knew it, Patrick Kennedy knew it, and yet they continue to fight it.	
Classified information was transmitted, as other government agencies have confirmed.	
Secretary Clinton & her team deliberately set up a personal server on which to conduct official, often classified, government business.	
The allegations of a potential quid pro quo by the Clinton State Department are serious http://www.burr.senate.gov/press/releases/intel-chairman-burr-allegations-of-a-potential-quid-pro-quo-by-clinton-state-department-are-serious …
