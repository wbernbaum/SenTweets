The actions this White House is taking each and every day damage the integrity of our justice system and undermine Americans’ faith.	
We can’t sit by as we fall behind in education. Time to make public colleges/universities tuition-free for the vast majority of Americans.

Black women are about 7% of the population, but make up just 2% of scientists and engineers. We need to fix that.	
Women made up the majority of calls into Congress during the health care fight, demanding to be heard. It’s clear: women won’t back down.	
In order to make what their white male counterparts have made by the age of 60, Black women ​on average ​would have to work until their 80s.	
By the end of their careers, on average Black women will have made $840,040 less than their white male counterparts. #BlackWomenEqualPay	#BlackWomenEqualPay
Black women must work nearly 20 months just to earn the same amount white men earned in 12 months. Unacceptable. #BlackWomensEqualPay	#BlackWomensEqualPay

Speaking truth to power sometimes makes people uncomfortable. But it’s those moments when we grow as a society.	
At a time when immigrants have been taken from their families in front of schools and outside courthouses, we must continue to speak out.	
Across the country, we have people actively trying to roll back birth control coverage and shut down clinics. We must defend women’s rights.	
Thank you to all the people who fought hard for health care these past months. We’ll need that enthusiasm across the nation in 2018.	
Let’s use this victory and keep showing up on so many other issues, including climate change, women’s rights & criminal justice reform.	
Walk with your chin up and your shoulders back. Be proud of what we’ve accomplished together. And then let's get back to work.
