For the good of the nation & for the good of the Senate, there should be no filibuster of Judge Gorsuch.	
I hope my Dem colleagues will recognize the need to invoke cloture on Judge Gorsuch’s nomination.	
Judge Gorsuch is a mainstream judge who has earned the respect of his judicial colleagues.	
The Senate has a very clear history of rejecting the use of the filibuster against #SCOTUS nominations.	#SCOTUS
A filibuster of a nominee like Judge Gorsuch would be a tremendous mistake & would harm the Senate as an institution.	
It’s clear from our mtg, a thorough examination of his record & watching last wks hearing, that Judge Gorsuch will rule fairly.	
Judge Scalia left behind a legacy of faithfully applying the law & Judge Gorsuch is a worthy successor.
