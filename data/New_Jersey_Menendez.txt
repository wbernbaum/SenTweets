Automatic weapons are illegal. Bump stocks that let ppl convert firearms into automatic weapons should be too. The Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act is a commonsense bill. Commonsense means Congress would be stupid not to pass it.	
We’re Americans. We are not powerless. We can help prevent horrific massacres like in Las Vegas. That’s why I cosponsored a bill banning bump stocks & plan to reintroduce my legislation to outlaw large capacity ammunition.
