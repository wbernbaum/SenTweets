Access to birth control is about freedom & the ability to plan & build a future. This attack on basic health care is wrong.	
The year is 2017, not 1917. Millions of Americans use contraception to prevent pregnancy, avoid STIs & manage health conditions.	
Evidently the GOP believe the single most important issue facing our nation is to let employers deny women access to birth control coverage.

And the GOP tax plan will explode the deficit, which will lead the GOP to say we need to gut Medicaid, Medicare, infrastructure & education.	
The GOP plan gets rid of the state/local tax deduction for working families while repealing the estate tax for a handful of rich families.	
The GOP tax plan delivers massive tax cuts to millionaires & giant corporations & kicks working families to the curb.	
The “new” Republican tax plan is the same warmed-over, trickle-down plan they’ve been pushing for decades.

Even worse, Trump & the GOP want Dems to blue slip (aka rubber-stamp) their pro-corporate, right-wing nominees to advance. It’s insulting.

The fight to save heath care isn't over. Sound the alarm. We need you to fight today & every day until this @SenateGOP bill is dead.	
Let me repeat: The Graham-Cassidy @SenateGOP "health care" bill IS Trumpcare, & it will rip health care away from millions of Americans.	
Coverage ripped away from tens of millions of Americans with Graham-Cassidy – kids with disabilities, grandparents in nursing homes.	
Graham-Cassidy completely eliminates help for families to buy health insurance. Gone. Good luck on your own.	
The @SenateGOP Graham-Cassidy "health care" bill cuts Medicaid funding & rolls back protections for people with pre-existing conditions.	
There's nothing new & improved about the Graham-Cassidy bill – it's the same cruel @SenateGOP "health care" bill, but on steroids.	
The @SenateGOP have a big 9/30 deadline to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And here's the scary thing: they might have the votes to do it.

The idea behind our bill is simple: @Equifax doesn't pay you when they sell your data. You shouldn't have to pay them to stop selling it.	
Companies like @Equifax make billions selling access to your data without your consent, then charge you if you want to stop them. It's nuts.	
Lot of people are outraged about the @Equifax data breach. I am too. Here’s what I’ve been doing about it this week.	
Insurance giant @AnthemInc sent Congress a ransom note: bigger tax cuts, or they’d pull out of more state health care exchanges.

The @CFPB's new rule would stop companies like @Equifax from avoiding legal accountability like this -- as long as @GOP doesn't reverse it.	
That's right: @Equifax fails to protect your data and then they demand you give up legal rights if you want to limit the damage they caused.	
. @Equifax is forcing you to give up your right to join a class action against the company if you want their credit protection product.pic.twitter.com/anu0SE58wg	
The @Equifax breach is Exhibit A for why we must stop @GOP from reversing the @CFPB's rule protecting your right to join class actions.	
It's also outrageous that @Equifax waited so long to disclose the breach -- needlessly leaving nearly half of America at risk for a month.	
It's outrageous that @Equifax -- a company whose one job is to collect consumer information -- failed to safeguard data for 143M Americans.

These next votes are on “repeal and run” of the Affordable Care Act – with a ban on Planned Parenthood funding thrown in for kicks.	
. @realDonaldTrump can pretend this is a military decision, but it isn't. Banning troops on gender identity is shameful & makes us less safe.	
By attacking thousands of troops, @realDonaldTrump makes clear that he cares more about extreme ideology than military readiness.	
The only thing – only thing – that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether or not they can handle the job.	
This vote will be the first of many @SenateGOP failures. We're doing everything we can to defend the health care of millions of Americans.	
In addition to being cruel, this first @SenateGOP proposal violates the Budget Act, so it needs 60 votes. It won't get them.

As our top law enforcement officer, the AG must be truthful and uphold the law. Sessions cannot continue to serve. He should resign.	
If AG Sessions were truly recused, he should have had nothing to do with firing Comey. He promised to recuse. He broke that promise.	
Today before Congress, AG Sessions refused to answer key questions about his discussions with @realDonaldTrump related to Comey’s firing.	
AG Sessions was forced to recuse himself from the Russia investigation after he lied to Congress about multiple meetings with the Russians.	
Jeff Sessions should have never been confirmed as Attorney General – and I’ve called for him to resign. #SessionsHearing	#SessionsHearing

No matter who @realDonaldTrump threatens, intimidates, or fires, it’s the job of law enforcement & Congress to get to the bottom of this.	
Comey’s sworn testimony today paints a picture of a President only interested in protecting himself, his aides, & his friends from the law.

AG Sessions didn’t just decide to recuse himself because he’s a nice guy. @TheJusticeDept regulations require it.

If @realDonaldTrump truly wants to help Syrians fleeing murderers, he should drop his effort to ban their children from America immediately.	
Congress must demand an actual strategy, clear goals, and a plan for achieving them before approving additional military action in Syria.	
The President's erratic approach to Syria is not a strategy. It underscores why our Constitution doesn't let Presidents wage war alone.	
Within a week, Trump's Admin went from asserting they wouldn't intervene to launching Tomahawk missiles against Assad. That's erratic.	
We need a plan to hold Assad accountable. But so far I’ve seen no compelling strategic justification for Trump's missile strike.	
If bankers want to go gamble with complex financial products, ok – but they shouldn’t do it with the money in grandma’s checking account.

Changing the rules to jam through a right-wing, corporate-owned judge means the GOP will have to own the Gorsuch Court.

The idea that Devin Nunes will investigate Trump/Russia is a farce. It's time for a real, independent, transparent inquiry.	
The FBI is investigating collusion between @realDonaldTrump's campaign & Russia. When will the GOP end the charade & put country first?	
Meanwhile, reports today say @realDonaldTrump's campaign manager was paid millions to help Putin influence US politics. Drip. Drip. Drip.	
After slamming leaks as "criminal," Devin Nunes is now privately briefing @realDonaldTrump - even leaking info to help him.	
Who does House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes think he works for: the American people or @realDonaldTrump?	
The FBI Director testified @realDonaldTrump's campaign is under investigation for collusion w/ Russia. Lifetime court appointments can wait.	
But is the Senate really going to pretend there's no cloud over @realDonaldTrump & move on w/ the Gorsuch nomination like things are normal?	
I've strongly opposed the Gorsuch nomination. Giant companies don't need another Supreme Court justice to tilt the law in their favor.	
Neil Gorsuch is up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court from a President whose campaign is under FBI investigation.	
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos apparently thinks her job is to hand @usedgov over to people who want to bilk students.	
We don’t need another Supreme Court justice to help giant corporations. We need a justice who will uphold equal justice for all.

Newsflash, @realDonaldTrump: The Senate confirms US Attorneys. And you're not replacing real prosecutors with cronies w/out a massive fight.

Now Jeff Sessions is AG – the final say on the law enforcement investigation into ties between the Trump campaign & Russia? What a farce.	
Jeff Sessions answered “No.” Turns out he met with the Russian Ambassador. Two months before the election.

Congress must pull its head out of the sand and launch a real, bipartisan, transparent inquiry into Russia. Our natl security is at stake.	
When did @WhiteHouse know that Flynn lied? What other contacts with Russia occurred during the campaign? Who knew what? Who approved what?	
This. Is. Not. Normal. @realDonaldTrump owes Americans a full account of his Admin’s dealings with Russia, both before & after the election.	
. @realDonaldTrump is still making money overseas & may have financial ties to Russia. Nobody knows since he STILL won’t release his taxes.	
Reports say our own intel agencies have corroborated parts of a dossier alleging that Russia has compromising info about @realDonaldTrump.	
This isn’t a game. Reports say the Russians conducted a series of successful cyber-attacks on our elections to help elect @realDonaldTrump.	
But American national security demands that we not allow Michael Flynn to become a scapegoat for this Admin's disturbing ties to Russia.	
Michael Flynn’s blinding religious hatred & shady Russian ties disqualified him as NSA on day one. His removal is a win for American values.	
I will be voting NO on Steve Mnuchin’s confirmation for @USTreasury tonight. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.

There’s nothing in Steve Mnuchin’s record to suggest he could stand up to Wall Street – or that he’d even want to stand up to Wall Street.	
Consider this MY warning: We won’t be silent. We will speak out. And we WILL persist.	
And you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessions’s radical hatred into @TheJusticeDept will hear from all of us, too.	
If Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism & bigotry into @TheJusticeDept, he'll hear from all of us.	
If Jeff Sessions turns a blind eye while @realDonaldTrump violates the Constitution or breaks the law, he'll hear from all of us.

I will not be silent while the Republicans rubber stamp an AG who will never stand up to the @POTUS when he breaks the law.	
I will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory & racist comments that have no place in our justice system.	
I spoke out about @SenatorSessions – until @SenateMajLdr McConnell decided to silence me.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVyq6kAN6u4 …	
On the floor, I read a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing @SenatorSessions's judicial nomination:https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/10/read-the-letter-coretta-scott-king-wrote-opposing-sessionss-1986-federal-nomination …	
Tonight on the Senate floor, I tried to speak about why @SenatorSessions is totally unfit to serve as Attorney General.	
The Wall St bankers may be popping champagne, but Americans haven't forgotten the 2008 financial crisis – and they won't forget today.	
The same day the Senate confirmed Rex Tillerson, the @HouseGOP passed a resolution to help @exxonmobil secretly funnel money to dictators.	
Given what's happening, Rex Tillerson's extensive Russia ties mean we cannot trust him to be a strong advocate for America's interests.	
I wish things were normal. But there is NOTHING NORMAL about this @POTUS and his Administration’s disturbing relationship with Russia.	
Based on the long and well-established record of Judge Neil Gorsuch, I will oppose his nomination. https://www.facebook.com/senatorelizabethwarren/posts/720622014766961 …	
Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss why I will be voting NO on Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State. Watch: http://floor.senate.gov/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&event_id=1199 …	
It’s time for the Senate to stand up for the Constitution & exert moral leadership. I urge my colleagues: Vote NO on Jeff Sessions for AG.	
Jeff Sessions is so dangerous that a Republican-controlled Senate rejected his nomination to a federal judgeship 30 years ago.	
Trump expects us to replace the AG w/ Jeff Sessions, whose career is defined by hostility to civil rights, immigrants & the rule of law.	
Let me repeat: the @POTUS fired the nation’s top law enforcement officer for refusing to defend an illegal, unconstitutional, immoral order.	
What a view tonight in front of the Supreme Court as Congressional Dems & hundreds of people gathered to say #NoMuslimBan #NoBanNoWall.pic.twitter.com/HPM8sFfIy4	#NoMuslimBan #NoBanNoWall
I urge my colleagues: vote NO on Steve Mnuchin. Don’t put the fates of the families you represent in the hands of a lying Wall St insider.	
Steve Mnuchin ran a bank that aggressively & sometimes illegally foreclosed on more than 60k families. That’s not up for debate. It’s fact.	
Proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Mayor @marty_walsh, @SenMarkey, @CAIRMass & 20k+ people in Boston today to say #NoBanNoWall.pic.twitter.com/Uar90gJOa7	#NoBanNoWall
We will not allow a Muslim ban in the United States of America. Here's what I said at Logan Airport tonight. #NoBanNoWallpic.twitter.com/XqeS9Iy14e	#NoBanNoWallpic
Tonight we fight for American values at airports all across this country. I'm at Logan Airport now to say: #nomuslimban #NoBanNoWall	#nomuslimban #NoBanNoWall
I urge @realDonaldTrump: embrace policies that reflect America’s core values & protect our ntl security. Rescind this executive order now.	
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we remember what can happen when hatred & fear turns neighbor against neighbor. When we abandon those in need.	#HolocaustRemembranceDay
Turning our back on refugees because of their religion creates recruiting fodder for ISIS and other terrorist groups.	
The Syrian refugees admitted to the US last yr are kids, doctors, teachers, engineers, & college students who sought safety from terrorists.	
We are a country of immigrants & refugees, of people fleeing religious persecution & seeking freedom, a country made strong by diversity.	
. @realDonaldTrump's order restricting immigrants from Muslim countries & freezing admission of refugees is a betrayal of American values.	
Let’s be clear: A Muslim ban by any other name is still a Muslim ban.	
Today, @realDonaldTrump closed the door on that little girl – & so many others who are running for their lives.	
And I met a 7-yr-old girl – younger than my own granddaughters – who had been sent out on that perilous journey alone.pic.twitter.com/00beGm7URo	
It’s hard to imagine a less qualified or more dangerous @USedgov nominee. The Senate should reject Betsy DeVos. http://www.warren.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1404 …	
I’ve heard from thousands of teachers, parents, & ed leaders in MA with deep concerns about Betsy DeVos. I hear & share their concerns.	
Betsy DeVos repeatedly demonstrated contempt for public ed. She plans to maintain financial ties that could create conflicts of interest.	
I will vote against Betsy DeVos’s nomination for @USedgov because it’s not in the best interests of America’s young people.	
. @realDonaldTrump’s actions today show an ugly indifference to immigrants & a profound misunderstanding of the real dangers we face.	
. @realDonaldTrump’s actions will divert local police dept resources away from protecting & building trust in our communities.	
. @realDonaldTrump’s actions will waste taxpayer dollars on irresponsible & misguided pet political projects.	
. @realDonaldTrump’s actions will hurt working parents & children who have risked their lives to flee war, violence & poverty.	
None of @realDonaldTrump’s actions today will make us safer. They’ll tear apart the fabric that makes us strong & united.	
Why not just declare January 25th as the Trump Administration's First Anti-Immigrant Day?	
Perhaps @POTUS @realDonaldTrump & the @GOP didn’t get the message Saturday: We’re not taking women’s rights back – not now, & not ever.	
I’ve been a cosponsor of a bill to repeal the global gag rule. I’ll be 1st in line to cosponsor again when @SenatorShaheen reintroduces it.	
. @POTUS Trump is reinstating the “global gag rule” to stop funding for overseas health centers that may provide abortion. This is insanity.	
Attacking @PPFA & US women’s reproductive rights isn’t enough for @realDonaldTrump & the @GOP. Today they made their fight global.	
We must measure @POTUS @realDonaldTrump by actions, not only words. And today he made it harder for families to achieve the American Dream.	
That’s 40,000 families who just lost their chance to buy a home thanks to brand-new @POTUS @realDonaldTrump.	
. @POTUS suspended a planned cut in FHA mortgage insurance premiums, which @nardotrealtor says will cost 40k families a shot at a new home.	
Just minutes after taking the oath of office, @POTUS Trump made it harder for working families to get a mortgage.http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-trump-fha-cut-20170120-story.html …	
Thank you for your terrific service, @JohnKerry. You’ve made MA proud, and we’re looking forward to having you back in the Commonwealth.	
When Mnuchin makes mistakes on complicated paperwork, he asks for forgiveness. When his customers made mistakes, he took their homes.	
Steve Mnuchin told @SenStabenow & @SenatorMenendez he didn’t disclose $100M because “the amount of paperwork” was tough. Boo hoo.	
The people who broke our economy & ruined people’s lives need to be held accountable. Not given the keys to break our economy again.	
No, @SenOrrinHatch, @POTUS didn’t force Mnuchin & OneWest to lie to homeowners about modifications & steal homes while making millions.	
. @SenPatRoberts says @RonWyden should take a valium? Maybe more Senators should be outraged by Wall St bankers that steal people's homes.	
. @GOPSenFinance didn’t want to hear Colleen – an 84-yr-old who might lose her home because of a reverse mortgage scam from Mnuchin’s bank.	
Steve Mnuchin ran a bank that lied & cheated people out of their homes. @GOPSenFinance didn’t want to hear those stories today.	
Paid sick days, a higher min wage, & discrimination-free hiring for federal contractors could go out the window with @realDonaldTrump.	
If @realDonaldTrump follows through on promises to “eliminate” or “repeal” @POTUS’s exec orders, workers could lose wages & benefits Monday.	
If Rep Tom Price won’t commit to protecting 1 in 3 Americans’ health care, he’s not the right person to run @HHSgov.	
It will take a lot more than petty rearranging of furniture to stop @SenateDems from fighting for working families, @SenateGOP. Try again.	
Tom Price has also championed proposals to privatize Medicare & radically restructure Medicaid – weakening our nation’s health care.	
Tom Price championed ACA repeal. He’s opposed improvements to women’s care. He’s cosponsored leg to discriminate against LGBT ppl.	
The job of @HHSgov sec is to “enhance & protect the health…of all Americans.” I’m not convinced Tom Price is willing or able to do that.	
If #BetsyDeVos won't use @usedgov’s many tools & resources to save students from fraud, she shouldn't be the Secretary of Education.	#BetsyDeVos
Tonight I asked #BetsyDeVos a set of q's about her education experience & commitment to protect students. Watch:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld6k2b-AEfU …	#BetsyDeVos
In fact, #BetsyDeVos has no experience with student loans, Pell Grants, or public education at all.	#BetsyDeVos
As @usedgov secretary, #BetsyDeVos would be in charge of running a $1 trillion student loan bank. She has no experience doing that.	#BetsyDeVos
I have 3 more rounds of q's that I would like to ask @usedgov nominee Betsy DeVos, @SenAlexander. I’m waiting. #1moreround #DeVosHearing	#1moreround #DeVosHearing
. @usedgov secretaries have served as teachers, school system leaders, governors – and Betsy DeVos has held no such position.	
There is no precedent for a @usedgov secretary with the lack of experience in public education that Betsy DeVos has.	
If being “the Foreclosure King” qualifies Mnuchin for @USTreasury, we should hear from ppl with first-hand experience with his businesses.	
. @ExxonMobil CEO Tillerson had a bad day yesterday. Wouldn’t call out his pal Putin. Claimed Exxon didn’t lobby against sanctions (it did).	
The solution is clear: @realDonaldTrump must divest fully – putting his assets in a true blind trust. If he won't, Congress must require it.	
Dr Carson danced around my q, because here’s the truth: He can’t promise it, b/c @realDonaldTrump won't eliminate his financial conflicts.	
I asked Ben Carson a simple q: Can you assure us no @HUDgov money will help @realDonaldTrump’s business empire?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihsF-bltgTU …	
And if @realDonaldTrump won’t follow the Constitution, Congress must fight back every step of the way. http://www.warren.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1342 …pic.twitter.com/kNrsXY0JnY	
If @realDonaldTrump truly wants to make America great & put America first, he’ll divest his assets by placing them in a true blind trust.	
The idea that @realDonaldTrump will still own massive business interests as @POTUS isn’t only unethical – it puts us all at risk.	
. @realDonaldTrump’s business plans for the Trump empire are a joke. Only nobody is laughing.	
If the @SenateGOP want to destroy health care in America, I will fight them every step of the way.	
Tonight I went to the Senate floor to tell the @SenateGOP: Repeal & run of the ACA is for cowards.https://youtu.be/n8wdxevom1w 	
The @SenateGOP have spent 8 years complaining about health care reform. But after 8 years of complaining, they still don’t have a plan.	
About to speak on the Senate floor about why we can't allow the @SenateGOP to repeal the ACA. Watch live: http://floor.senate.gov/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&event_id=1177 …	
Americans STILL deserve to know that the President is doing what’s best for the country – not what’s best for himself & his businesses.	
It’s been 25 days since @realDonaldTrump promised to outline his plans for the Trump empire. We’re still waiting.	
Cabinet officials must put our country's interests before their own. No conf hearings should be held until we’re certain that’s the case.	
This is ridiculous. @realDonaldTrump’s noms can’t drag their feet on ethics paperwork while their Senate friends try to run out the clock.	
. @OfficeGovEthics wrote back with “great concern” about the @SenateGOP’s confirmation hearings.pic.twitter.com/YIC6e5TBSs	
Confirmation hearings start Tuesday, so @SenSchumer & I asked @OfficeGovEthics how the ethics reviews are going.pic.twitter.com/z04Vyhxx5b	
Confirmation hearings historically aren’t conducted until the @OfficeGovEthics certifies that each nominee has no unresolved conflicts.	
The @SenateGOP are bypassing important steps to make sure these billionaire cabinet nominees are free of dangerous conflicts of interest.	
I’m cosponsoring @CoryBooker’s bill so the fed gov can't engage in surveillance or harassment of immigrant groups.https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/01/05/democrats-must-do-everything-possible-to-resist-trumps-excesses-heres-what-that-might-look-like/ …	
Targeting people based on their religion flies squarely in the face of who we are as Americans – and it makes our country less safe.	
Welcome @SenDuckworth & @SenCortezMasto to the US Senate!pic.twitter.com/cwWVPOWP0K	
Tell us, @GOP: Who, exactly, thinks that the problem with Washington is that we have too many rules requiring the gov to act ethically?	
And now the @HouseGOP is gutting its ethics office in the middle of the night – hours before the new Congress is sworn in.	
Trump’s cabinet of billionaires & CEOs have ignored gov ethics rules & dragged their feet on FBI background checks & financial disclosures.	
. @realDonaldTrump still hasn’t announced plans for his business empire while falsely claiming the President can’t have conflicts.	
We’ve received heartbreaking stories of ppl hurt by OneWest Bank & Steve Mnuchin. There’s still time to share yours: https://democrats.senate.gov/ForeclosureKing/ …pic.twitter.com/3YFm1Er3Nt	
Every nominee must follow the law before they are confirmed – even rich ones who think the rules don't apply.http://www.rollcall.com/news/cabinet-nominees-senate-democrats …	
Rs & Ds always require cabinet nominees to complete FBI background checks & ethics agreements to resolve financial conflicts.	
Federal agency appointees can face jail time if they make official government decisions that affect their own financial interests.	
Cabinet officials must put the interests of the nation ahead of their own bank accounts. It's not just good government – it's the law.	
Thanks @POTUS & @DHSgov for reaffirming US values by ending the xenophobic NSEERS program. We're better than that.http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/nyregion/obama-to-dismantle-visitor-registry-before-trump-can-revive-it.html …	
Placing assets in a true blind trust has been the standard for previous presidents. Our bill makes clear we expect Trump to do the same.	
. @SenatorCardin, @ChrisCoons, @SenatorDurbin, @SenJeffMerkley & I will introduce a bill in January to implement the Emoluments Clause.	
The only way for @realDonaldTrump to eliminate conflicts-of-interest is to divest his financial interests & place them in a blind trust.	
Americans deserve to know that the President is doing what’s best for the country – not using his office to do what’s best for himself.	
As we’ve seen with the recent Russian cyberattacks, the nature of our national security threats is changing, and we need to change too.	
I’m pleased to announce that I’ll be serving on the Senate Committee on Armed Services in the next Congress.	
. @exxonmobil can’t bully @MassAGO Healey in a TX courtroom or anywhere else. We stand with Maura Healey.https://twitter.com/cbsboston/status/808399966632812545 …	
I’m glad the Obama Admin has fought hard to clean up the for-profit college industry. Will the next Admin fight for students or the crooks?	
Congress should pass the bipartisan legislation ready to go TODAY to make good on its 70-yr promise to our miners.https://youtu.be/-t3UjRXg928 	
90k miners will also soon lose their pensions. It’s $7k/yr on avg – not much –but the promise of SS + those pensions are all many have got.	
If Congress goes home & doesn’t act, 16k miners will lose their insurance by the end of the month. 2.5k more by March. 4k more by July.	
70 years ago, the gov made a promise to union coal miners: health insurance & pensions for putting their lives at risk to power our country.	
Appointing Andrew Puzder to run the agency responsible for protecting workers is a slap in the face for every hard-working American family.	
Andrew Puzder plotted to replace his workers with machines because they are "always polite" & "never take a vacation."	
Andrew Puzder looks down on working people. At @Hardees & @CarlsJr, he got rich squeezing front-line workers on wages, overtime & benefits.	
Many in our communities rely on free broadcast TV. I share @SenMarkey’s concerns about NBC signal loss in MA & call on @comcast for answers.https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/806177669859704832 …	
Republicans also broke their promise in the #CuresAct to meaningfully boost guaranteed funding for NIH and the opioid crisis.	#CuresAct
So will you keep your promise to protect Medicare & Medicaid, @realDonaldTrump? My colleagues & I want to know: http://www.warren.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1321 …	
But the election is over, @realDonaldTrump, & now you’re shifting to support changes that would gut Medicare & Medicaid.	
During your presidential campaign, @realDonaldTrump, you promised you were the only Republican who would protect Medicare & Medicaid.	
I know I speak for millions when I say: Thank you for your tireless fight, @VP Biden. We wish you the very best. #thanksjoepic.twitter.com/rbNKluTtOs	#thanksjoepic
We know the big bank onslaught to roll back critical financial rules & pad bankers’ pockets is coming. It’s up to all of us to fight back.	
Big banks like @WellsFargo have no shame. No matter how much they hurt investors & customers, they're prowling to gut Dodd-Frank.	
Fresh off of defrauding customers, @WellsFargo’s new CEO wants Congress to weaken the financial rules.http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/06/investing/wells-fargo-trump-regulation-tim-sloan/index.html …	
Steve Mnuchin would get to decide how to regulate 30 of our biggest banks – including the bank where he currently serves as board member.	
I told my Dem colleagues: We weren’t sent to Congress to roll over to drug companies. Show some spine & fight back.https://youtu.be/A1s12VfvS2g 	
Congress should pass the bipartisan Retirement Savings Lost & Found Act – a commonsense bill to help Americans retire with dignity.	
. @realDonaldTrump’s transition “disarray” & serious conflicts of interest raise questions that taxpayers deserve to have answered.	
The President of the US should work for you – & not exploit the most powerful office in the world & your tax dollars to make a quick buck.	
We should all be very worried if a @realDonaldTrump Education Dept will stand up for students being ripped off at shady for-profit colleges.	
It is totally unprecedented for a President-elect of the United States to have to settle fraud lawsuits before taking office.	
. @realDonaldTrump just paid $25 million for breaking the law & ripping off students.http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/11/18/new-york-attorney-general-announces-million-settlement-trump-university-case/Nrb5XwsyLz44NUuYglPirI/story.html …	
. @realDonaldTrump swindled thousands of students at his sham “Trump University.” That’s not up for debate anymore – that’s a fact.	
Today, a new GOP Senate must decide whether self-interest & political cowardice will prevent them from once again doing what is right.	
30 yrs ago, a GOP Senate rejected @SenatorSessions’ judicial nomination, affirming no compromise with racism; no negotiation with hate.	
If @realDonaldTrump refuses to reverse on @SenatorSessions, it falls on the Senate to exercise fundamental moral leadership for our nation.	
Gov @MittRomney: when you're meeting with @realDonaldTrump, maybe you could bring your binders full of women with you?pic.twitter.com/4tJdYxTchc	
Today I spoke about @realDonaldTrump’s decision to hand over the government to the worst special interests. Watch:https://youtu.be/FB14HbLmKf8 	
. @realDonaldTrump isn’t “draining the swamp.” He’s inviting the biggest, ugliest swamp monsters in the front door.	
Registering & tracking Americans based on race or religion is idiotic. Disgusting. Unconstitutional. And it’s a recruiting bonanza for ISIS.	
If @realDonaldTrump thinks we’re going to just roll over while his Wall St buddies crash our economy again, they're in for a rude awakening.	
I ask the financial industry: Bigotry is bad for our country & business. What message do you send customers & employees if you stay silent?	
. @realDonaldTrump appointed a bigot as his WH Chief Strategist. This is a moral test for all of us – including the business community.	
Brought a longtime friend & my new colleague by the office today – our new Senator-Elect from CA, @KamalaHarris!pic.twitter.com/6PbkLwlRQV	
#draintheswamp on your team, @realDonaldTrump. The American people demanded changes, & we’re watching you every step of the way.	#draintheswamp
And I sent a letter to @realDonaldTrump raising my concerns about the insiders running his transition team: http://www.warren.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1298 …	
Today I told a room full of CEOs at the #WSJCEOCouncil: Nobody wants them to keep running the gov for themselves.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tv6Gw8nZ5o …	#WSJCEOCouncil
Keeping these lobbyists & insiders on your team sends a clear message, @realDonaldTrump: your campaign was a giant con.	
You already broke your promise, @realDonaldTrump. You stacked your transition team with Wall Street elites, insiders & lobbyists.	
. @realDonaldTrump, you promised the American people you’d #draintheswamp of lobbyists & insiders rigging the system for the rich & powerful.	#draintheswamp
The President of the United States should condemn bigots, @realDonaldTrump. Not give them a West Wing office to decide our country's future.	
Steve Bannon promoted white nationalism, @realDonaldTrump. He's been praised by KKK supporters & denounced by @splcenter & @ADL_National .	
Tell us, @realDonaldTrump: You said you'd be a "President for all." Then why are you embracing the ugliness & divisiveness of your campaign?	
Let me be clear: It's foolish for any Dem to think that weakening support for the @CFPB is good for the country or good for us as a party.	
Anyone in Congress – GOP or Dem – who votes to weaken the @CFPB will declare loud & clear they represent giant banks, not working families.	
The @CFPB has returned over $11 BILLION to consumers who have been cheated by big banks & financial institutions.	
If I were Wall Street & the GOP, I’d be scared too: The @CFPB goes after big banks like @WellsFargo when they break the law.	
The real reason Wall St & their @GOP allies are going after the @CFPB is because it’s working too darn well for consumers & must be stopped.	
You’re going to hear a lot of reasons why we must make these changes to the @CFPB. Not one of them is going to be true.	
It’s only been a few days since the election & Wall St banks & their @GOP friends are already licking their chops to undercut the @CFPB.	
And @FCC should ban unreasonable pay-for-privacy schemes that coerce consumers to give up #privacy for discounts.http://bit.ly/2dvEs9g 	#privacy
The @FCC can do something about #broadband #privacy – & they should @TomWheelerFCC @JRosenworcel @MClyburnFCC @AjitPaiFCC @mikeofcc	#broadband #privacy

Congress should pass the #SAVEBenefits Act in Nov to give a much-needed boost to millions of Americans on Soc Security who have earned it.	#SAVEBenefits
.@RepDuckworth & I introduced the #SAVEBenefits Act to give 70M Americans a one-time 3.9% Social Security payment. There's still time.	#SAVEBenefits
Today the @SocialSecurity Admin announced a 0.3% COLA for 2017. For many Americans struggling to make ends meet, that offers little relief.	
The SEC needs new leadership to return to its mission to protect investors. @POTUS should use his authority to designate a new chair today	
SEC Chair White has refused to advance a rule to require public corporations to disclose political spending despite broad bipartisan support	
But under Chair White the SEC routinely ignores needs of investors to cater to interests of big businesses, dragging its feet on key rules	
The SEC has a simple purpose: to protect investors by ensuring they have the information they need to make decisions	
Today I asked @POTUS to immediately designate a new Chair of the SEC to replace Mary Jo White: http://www.warren.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1275 …	
I am heartsick for the 2 brave @bostonpolice officers shot in Boston, their families & the entire BPD. Our gratitude & prayers are with you.	
A bank CEO should not be able to oversee a massive fraud & simply walk away to enjoy his millions in retirement.	
A bank teller would face criminal charges & a prison sentence for stealing a handful of 20s from the cash drawer.	
If @WellsFargo’s John Stumpf is leaving with all of his ill-gotten millions, that's still not real accountability.	
As I said: @WellsFargo CEO Stumpf should resign, return every nickel he made during the scam, & face DOJ/SEC investigation. He’s 1 for 3.
