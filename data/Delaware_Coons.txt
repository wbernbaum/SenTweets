I am deeply disappointed in this legislative process – we should know exactly what is in the bill & debate it properly.	
No public hearings, no final version, no consultations with health care experts. This is not how we improve our health care system.	
Today, we are voting on a motion to proceed even though we have no idea what version of the health care bill we will be voting on.

Christopher Wray, if confirmed, must report any interference with the investigation to Congress.	
I'm concerned that Attorney General Sessions hasn't complied with the scope of his recusal.	
. @POTUS said when he fired Comey that he was thinking about the FBI's investigation of Russian interference.	
I questioned FBI Director nominee Christopher Wray in the Senate Judiciary Cmte. Here are some things we talked abthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EndUMFmhiqs&t=2s …	
It is the fundamental responsibility of the commander-in-chief to devise, explain, & defend U.S. military engagement. @POTUS' most impt job.	
It's an incredibly ill-advised time for deep cuts to State Dept. US diplomacy will be key in post-ISIS Mosul opposing Iranian influence	
Calls for regime change or war in Iran are reckless. A collision course w Iran is not inevitable: we can avoid unnecessary military conflict	
And finally, it brings us back to two, core questions: what did the President know and when did he know it?	
This is a moment for members of the House and Senate to put aside partisanship and think about what's in the best interests of our country.	
This is exactly why it is so important that we continue to have an independent investigation led by someone like Bob Mueller	
In particular, I was floored that his response to the emails wasn't to be shocked or concerned. It wasn't to hand this over to the FBI.	
First, when I was shown these tweets by Donald Trump Jr. earlier today, I was floored.

I oppose these severe cuts to federally sponsored research.	
I am very concerned about cuts to R&D and innovation in the Trump budget which are critical to American competitiveness.	
Our president should make our country stronger & safer. But his #budget & proposed cuts to diplomacy & development would do the opposite.	#budget
Trump's #budget would threaten our security, our economy, our environment & our global leadership. I'll fight against this shortsightedness.	#budget
This isn't what @POTUS promised. Jeopardizing the health care of millions is a terrible move for our country.	
Trump's #budget calls for $6B in cuts to #NIH & $1.3B in cuts to #CDC. This is a huge step backwards in health care & research.	#budget #NIH #CDC
Republican health bill would strip $839B from Medicaid. Trump's #budget would strip another $610B. We need more coverage, not less.	#budget
Trump's #budget would strip over $1 trillion from programs that help the poor like SNAP, EITC, TANF & Children's Health Insurance.	#budget
I will fight to ensure these proposed cuts are never implemented. Remember, it is Congress that passes the budget, not the president.	
Trump's #budget would be devastating for millions of Americans, & most of all, for the most vulnerable of our neighbors, family, & friends.	#budget

(6/6) He needs to see Russia for what it is: an adversary who has worked to undermine democracy in Europe and now in the United States.

(4/6) The President-elect also continued to show a lack of understanding of our country's relationship with Russia.	
(3/6) If the Pres-elect were sincere abt absolving himself of these issues, he should fully divest from his company & release tax returns

The bottom line is that #ACA has helped millions of Americans access high-quality coverage. Trumpcare is an empty promise. It's that simple.	#ACA
Dems have been clear that #ACA is not perfect. That’s why we've spent 6 yrs trying to find R's willing to work together to improve the law.	#ACA
