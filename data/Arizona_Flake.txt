Trade deficits are often confused with budget deficits. Here's context from Wash Post on our trade deficit with Mexico. We still benefitpic.twitter.com/zd9m44gKBU	
NAFTA is good for Mexico. Pew Research found that since 2009 more Mexican immigrants have returned to Mexico than have migrated to the U.S.	
Since NAFTA was adopted, U.S. exports to Mexico have gone from $68 billion in 1994 to $235 billion in 2016. Trade is good for all of us.	
Free trade is not a zero sum game where someone wins and someone loses. NAFTA benefits both the U.S. & Mexico.http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2017/01/26/sens-john-mccain-and-jeff-flake-defend-us-mexico-trade-deal-president-donald-trump/97111960/ …
