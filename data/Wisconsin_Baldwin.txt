This weekend, I joined Marv & Linda Simcakoski for an update on how our reforms named after their son Jason are improving veterans' care.pic.twitter.com/qVk1kAzoJX	
. @SenateMajLdr said he wanted to hear ideas on improving health care. @SenJohnMcCain & I have legislation to take on rising Rx drug costs.	
Now is the time to work together to stabilize the health insurance market, make health care more affordable & take on rising Rx drug costs.	
The message from Wisconsinites is clear: Work across party lines to make things better, not worse.	
I joined R's and D'S to vote no because the people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take people’s health care away.	
Thank you Wisconsin for speaking out and sharing your stories. YOU are the reason that the #SkinnyRepeal was defeated last night.	#SkinnyRepeal
I joined Republicans and Democrats to vote against the health care repeal bill last night. This is why:pic.twitter.com/wgefWO2nXB	
#SkinnyRepeal is Washington talk for more uninsured, rising premiums, and higher out of pocket costs. I'm voting no for Wisconsin.	#SkinnyRepeal
When #AmericaSpeaksOut, we can defeat this repeal effort. Join Anna and make your voice heard today!	#AmericaSpeaksOut
This is wrong. We should be working to make health care better and more affordable, not worse and more expensive.	
No matter what version you look at, Congressional Republicans are proposing higher costs and more uninsured Americans.	
There are only hours left of debate on the Senate floor. We can't let up! Don't leave anything on the table. Make your voice heard!	
For months, I've heard Wisconsinites speak out and share their health care stories. Today, we need to keep up the fight!	
It's not just tweets. This Administration is taking a formal, official stance against the rights of LGBT Americans.https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/the-justice-department-just-argued-against-gay-rights-in-a?utm_term=.qmN8Q5WEr#.aoLYy6VO8 …	#
Happening now on the Senate floor: I just voted NO on #RepealAndRun. I just voted YES to protect Medicaid.	#RepealAndRun
The people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take people's health care away.	
To those transgender Americans currently in the U.S. military, thank you. Your service strengthens our military and our nation.	
I stand with military leaders who support moving in the right direction. We shouldn't discriminate against anyone who wants to serve.	
A ban against any patriotic American who wants to serve our country is wrong.	
Do you remember the Cruz plan? It will make bad legislation even worse.	
The first health care repeal amendment up tonight is the Cruz plan. I'm voting no.	
Your stories, your voices drive this fight. Together, we can defeat this effort to take health care away from millions of Americans.	
It’s also personal for every Wisconsinite. I’ve heard from families across the state about why they are fighting against this repeal.pic.twitter.com/NdSmcyfgK5	
For me, this is personal. When I was little, I had a childhood illness and was branded as a child with a pre-existing condition.pic.twitter.com/F6AjSHb4lS

LIVE on the steps of the Capitol right now to speak out and share the stories of Wisconsinites. https://www.facebook.com/senatortammybaldwin/posts/10155589708912140 …	
Right now, the Senate is voting to move forward on partisan health care repeal that will make things worse, not better. I'm voting no.	
It’s time that we work together to do the job that the American people sent us here to do.	
It’s time to stop the partisan nonsense. The people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take people’s health care away.	
And then there is Zoe in Seymour. She was born with congenital heart defect. Her parents are scared this repeal plan will make things worse.pic.twitter.com/98Z2vwU4L4	
Thanks to Medicaid, Kyle was able to live at home, have an education, get a driver’s license and now he’s attending college!	
Americans want us to work together to lower costs. No one wants a partisan plan that takes people’s health care away.	
People with pre-existing conditions don’t want to be thrown into a high-risk pool or priced out of the coverage they have today.	
People don't want higher costs for less care.

The people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take people's health care away. They sent me to protect the care they have today.	
This isn't just personal for me, it's personal for the Wisconsin families that I work for. I've listened to them & I'm giving them a voice.	
Raising costs for a family with a pre-existing condition isn’t right, it’s not fair and it’s not who we are.	
No parent or grandparent should have to lay awake wondering if the health care they have today for their family will be there tomorrow.

8/ Pence is looking to give individuals and groups a #LicenseToDiscriminate against people because of who they are or who they love.	#LicenseToDiscriminate
7/ @POTUS should do the right thing, not be played as a puppet by @VP Pence to advance an extreme right agenda. #LicenseToDiscriminate	#LicenseToDiscriminate

5/ All Americans are created equal under the law and every American deserves the freedom to live their lives free from discrimination.	
4/ This isn’t presidential leadership, this is an attack on our founding principles and authorizing taxpayer funded discrimination.	
3/ @realDonaldTrump said he wanted to be a President "for all Americans" but signing this discriminatory order would break his word.	
2/ I support religious freedom and the freedom of full equality for every American. That's what makes this so concerning.	
1/ I'm very concerned by reports that President Trump plans to sign a #LicenseToDiscriminate executive order on Thursday.	#LicenseToDiscriminate
