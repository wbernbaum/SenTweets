Since it will be four years before the U.S. is officially out, @POTUS could work toward an agreement that could be ratified by the Senate.	
If the Paris agreement were so important to the future of the world, why was President Obama so unwilling to have it ratified as a treaty?	
No one should be surprised that one man deciding the fate of our country with the Paris climate agreement can easily be undone by one man.	
Unlike France and Germany, President Obama purposely chose not to have the Paris agreement ratified by the Senate.
