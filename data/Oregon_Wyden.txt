The GOP tax plan is a heist to take trillions from Social Security & Medicare & give it to the wealthy in tax breaks. We will not stand for it. 15/15	
#TaxReform ought to be all about giving everybody in America the opportunity to get ahead & be partisan. #TrumpTaxScam is the opposite. 14/	#TaxReform #TrumpTaxScam
. @SenateDems laid out our principles on #taxreform. @SenateMajLdr rejected them within hours. That’s not bipartisanship. 13/	#taxreform
The Republican framework looks less like a real effort at tax reform than a shameless attempt to accommodate the president’s boasting about the biggest tax cut ever. 12/	
#TrumpTaxScam means millions of middle-class Americans are facing the prospect of a big tax hike. 11/	#TrumpTaxScam
Current middle-class tax breaks on the chopping block: The personal exemption. The state and local tax deduction. Incentives for retirement savings, education, home ownership, & more. 10/	
When you do the math on what Republicans have on offer, you’re looking at upward of 4, 5, 6 TRILLION dollars in tax giveaways to the most fortunate. 9/	
The top income tax rate goes down, the bottom income tax rate goes up. #trumptaxscam 8/	#trumptaxscam
There’s a brand new passthrough loophole -- the Grand Canyon of loopholes -- that invites tax cheats to skip out on paying their fair share to Social Security & Medicare. 6/	
The Republican tax cut framework green-lights the entire wish list for big corporations and the wealthy. 5/	
There is no comparison between the bipartisan #taxreform I wrote & the #TrumpTaxScam – ZERO. 4/	#taxreform #TrumpTaxScam
What GOP have offered in the Trump tax plan is a tax INCREASE to millions of middle-class families to pay for massive, unprecedented tax giveaways to corporations and those at the top. 3/
