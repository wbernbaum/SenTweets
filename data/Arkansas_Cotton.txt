9/9 Think instead of smaller working-class enclaves where wages have stagnated or dropped over a generation. We don't think of them enough.	
8/9 But to extent Houston is relevant, I encourage you to look outside 4th largest city w/ robust oil & tech industry & high median income.	
7/9 Your Houston vignette seems more of an argument for local housing deregulation, not higher levels low-skill immigration.	
6/9 The powerful & elite reap the benefits of constant influx of low-skill labor while working Americans & recent immigrants bear the costs.	
5/9 It's these 'forgotten' groups that my immigration bill seeks to help.	
4/9 NAS report also shows low-skill immigration harms the employment of native teens, low-skill disadvantaged minorities & prior immigrants.	
3/9 It says while negative wage effects are 'very small' for all 'natives OVERALL' the effect is more severe for natives w/o a HS diploma.	
2/9 You misquote the Nat'l Acad. of Sciences report. It DOESN'T say that negative wage effect on natives w/o HS diploma is 'very small.'
