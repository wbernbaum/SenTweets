Good riddance to Bannon, but @realDonaldTrump must do much more to heal the country from the wounds inflicted by his vicious rhetoric.	
This week, Trump has actively defended those who represent worst forms of hate. This conduct is beyond unacceptable, and must be condemned.	
An American President must stand firmly against any form of white supremacy - not stand up for those marching w/neo-Nazis, KKK, etc.	
Congress should censure Trump for supporting hate and encouraging white supremacists who traffic in violence.
