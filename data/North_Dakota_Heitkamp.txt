Cannot support a bill that would rip health care away from tens of thousands of NDans or make it unaffordable. Here's my full statementpic.twitter.com/xW4fhW1ZCu	
I have many ideas that I’ll keep offering. I’m hopeful there is now an opening for progress. My office door remains wide open.	
For years I’ve said the health reform law isn’t perfect, no law ever is – but we can make it work thru needed reforms	
GOP & Dems should be able to join together to pass transparent, bipar. reforms to improve health care, as I’ve been working to accomplish	
Many hoped this bill would pass for political reasons, instead it failed for the right reasons - it hurt our neighbors & communities	
History will remember where each of us stood during this vote. We should be here to do what is best for the American people.	
I could not support a bill that was crafted behind closed doors & would have ripped health care away from tens of thousands of NDans	
Far too often in Congress, politics dictates legislation, and it needs to stop. The bill the Senate voted on tonight was a bad bill.	
With majority of Senate, I voted against Senate GOP health care bill that would have ripped away health care from NDans & increase premiumspic.twitter.com/ZXuqmGus01	
Have been offering many ideas since 2013 to make health care work better. Hope to work w/ Dems & Republicans on them and other ideas.https://twitter.com/SenatorHeitkamp/status/889939538969284608 …	
2. What do insurance companies say will be the consequences of elimination of the individual mandate?	
1. If the business mandate is eliminated how many people will be forced to get health insurance on the individual market?	
Since Republicans refuse to allow questions here is what I would ask about the GOP health care bill if they would allow it:	
No hearing on the GOP health care bill and now won't even answer a question on the bill. Beyond frustrating

I’ve long said, Congress must work across party lines to seek transparent, bipartisan reforms to our health care system so it works better	
Pushing through a bill without even talking with those on the other side of the aisle isn’t the way to do it.	
We absolutely need to improve the current health care system – but this bill isn’t the way to do it.	
Which includes kids w/disabilities, seniors in nursing homes, folks who rely on rural hospitals, & those seeking treatment for opioid abuse.	
Today was a vote that will go down in history. Republicans in the Senate knowingly voted to strip away health care for 23 million Americans

Real leadership means stepping up to the challenge, working across the aisle & looking for honest results to improve the health care system.

90,000 ND kids & individuals w/disabilities, seniors & low-income families rely on Medicaid-which GOP health care bill would severely cut

U.S. can’t remain an energy leader if we aren’t even at the negotiating table.	
No agreement is perfect, and adjusting our commitments or timetable would have been viable avenues to pursue.	
Abandoning Paris climate accord is a reckless decision that forfeits an oppty to guarantee a viable future for ND energy on the global level

Long said that I'll work w/anyone to fix our health care system, but the GOP health care bill - which is terrible for ND - is a non-starter	
Those who voted for this bill should know better–it was for their own self-interest, & not for the people of our country or North Dakota	
Biggest savings from GOP health care bill comes from $830B in cuts to Medicaid - a program 90,000+ NDans rely on for quality/affordable care	
GOP health care bill would disproportionately hurt those in rural communities who rely on rural health clinics & hospitals for coverage	
It would also make coverage unaffordable for the 300,000+ North Dakotans w/pre-existing conditions like asthma, cancer, or being pregnant.	
The Republican health care bill would rip away health care from 23 million Americans by 2026, including more than 28,000 North Dakotans.

That’s what I’ve been trying to do b/c no family should have to choose between getting critical care for a loved one or facing bankruptcy.
