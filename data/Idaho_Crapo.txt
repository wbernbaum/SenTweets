I can no longer endorse Donald Trump. Read my full statement:pic.twitter.com/lfa9mYZbdC	
He must take full responsibility for this unacceptable disrespect of women, renounce it and apologize, no excuses.	
Comments made by Mr. Trump are outrageous, & he must apologize immediately for his disrespectful, profane & demeaning language about women.
